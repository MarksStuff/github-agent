## User Authentication & Authorization System

### Core Requirements:
- JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- Role-based access control (RBAC) with granular permissions
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) support
- Session management with configurable timeouts

### Technical Specifications:
- Integration with OAuth2 providers (Google, GitHub, etc.)
- Password policy enforcement (complexity, rotation)
- Audit logging for all authentication events
- Rate limiting for failed login attempts

### Security Considerations:
- Secure password storage with bcrypt hashing
- Protection against brute force attacks
- CSRF token validation
- Secure cookie handling with HTTPOnly and SameSite flags

### Implementation Notes:
This feature requires updates to:
1. Database schema (users, roles, permissions tables)
2. API middleware for authentication/authorization
3. Frontend login/registration components
4. Admin panel for user management
