# MCP Codebase Server - User Stories Development Plan

## Phase 1: Foundation and Basic Setup

### US001 - Basic MCP Server Setup - DONE
**Moved to**: [`improvements/mcp_server_user_stories/US001-Basic-MCP-Server-Setup.md`](file:///Volumes/Code/github-agent/improvements/mcp_server_user_stories/US001-Basic-MCP-Server-Setup.md)

### US002 - Repository Configuration - DONE
**As an administrator** I want to define repositories in a configuration file so that the system knows which codebases to index.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Extend existing `repositories.json` schema with `python_path` field for Python repositories
- Server validates configuration on startup with clear error messages:
  - **Syntactic validation**: JSON structure, required parameters present (path, language, description, python_path), parameter values have correct types
  - **Semantic validation**: path points to existing directory, directory contains a Git repository, python_path points to valid Python executable, extract GitHub owner/repo from git remote
- Support for both absolute and relative paths (already exists)
- Manual editing of `repositories.json` file

### US003 - Single Python Repository Discovery - DONE
**As a developer** I want to search for Python symbols by name in a single repository so that I can quickly locate classes and functions without grep.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Index a single Python repository on startup
- Basic symbol search tool: `search_symbols(query, repository_id)`
- Return symbol name, type (class/function/variable), file location
- Sub-second response time for simple queries

## Phase 2: Core Language Server Integration

### US011 - Incremental Indexing
**As a developer** I want fast index updates that only process changed files so that I don't wait for full re-indexing after small changes.
