# US005 - Python LSP Integration - Task Breakdown

## User Story
**As a developer** I want accurate symbol definitions and references through Python LSP so that I get semantic understanding rather than text matching.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Launch and manage pyright server instance per repository (with pluggable LSP architecture)
- LEVERAGES existing virtual environment settings from `repositories.json`
- `find_definition(symbol, repository_id)` tool returns precise location
- `find_references(symbol, repository_id)` tool returns all usage locations
- Handle Python imports, classes, functions, and variables correctly
- Abstract LSP interface allows easy switching between pyright/pylsp

## Task Breakdown

- Fallback to symbol index when LSP is unavailable

**Changes Required**:

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- `find_definition` returns accurate file location and line number
- `find_references` returns all usage locations for a symbol
- Tools work with Python imports, classes, functions, and variables
- All tests pass without warnings

### Task 4: Repository Integration
**Description**: Integrate LSP management into the existing repository management system to ensure each repository gets its own LSP server instance.

**Implementation Details**:
- Extend `RepositoryManager` to manage LSP server instances
- Add LSP server startup/shutdown to repository lifecycle
- Implement repository-specific LSP workspace configuration
- Add LSP server health monitoring and automatic restart
- Handle virtual environment detection and configuration

**Changes Required**:

- **Abstract LSP architecture** enables easy addition of other language servers (Swift, TypeScript, etc.)
- **Pyright provides superior type analysis** compared to pylsp, including better IntelliSense and type checking
- **Hybrid approach** combines fast indexing with live LSP queries for optimal performance
- Virtual environment support is crucial for Python LSP accuracy
