# Enhanced Multi-Agent Workflow System

## Overview

Transform the current clunky multi-agent workflow into a seamless, resumable, and visual experience with GitHub integration for feedback loops.

## Key Requirements

- **Idempotent**: Can resume from any failure point
- **GitHub Integration**: Auto-commit, push, and wait for feedback
- **Visual Progress**: Rich CLI output and web dashboard
- **State Management**: Persistent state across runs
- **User Interaction**: Pause points for review and feedback

## Architecture

```
workflow.py
├── WorkflowState (persistent state)
├── StageOrchestrator (pipeline management)
├── GitHubIntegrator (commits, feedback)
├── OutputManager (CLI + web dashboard)
└── Agent interfaces (existing agents)
```

- [ ] Create `workflow.config.yaml`
- [ ] Build project profile system
- [ ] Add environment-specific settings
- [ ] Implement secret management

### Phase 3: GitHub Integration
**Goal**: Full GitHub feedback loop

#### Task 3.1: Auto-commit and Push
- [ ] Enhanced commit message generation
- [ ] Conventional commit format
- [ ] PR template generation
- [ ] Push notifications

#### Task 3.2: GitHub Comment Polling
- [ ] Poll for new GitHub comments
- [ ] Parse comments for workflow commands
- [ ] Implement comment threading
- [ ] Add webhook listener option

#### Task 3.3: Feedback Incorporation
- [ ] Process feedback and modify workflow
- [ ] Update state based on feedback
- [ ] Continue workflow after feedback
- [ ] Track feedback history

### Phase 4: Visualization
**Goal**: Rich visual feedback and monitoring

#### Task 4.1: Rich CLI Output
- [ ] Advanced progress visualization
- [ ] Live log streaming
- [ ] Collapsible sections
- [ ] Status dashboard layout

#### Task 4.2: Web Dashboard
- [ ] Flask/FastAPI web server
- [ ] Real-time progress page
- [ ] File explorer for artifacts
- [ ] Syntax-highlighted previews

#### Task 4.3: Output Organization
- [ ] Structured output directories
- [ ] Generate INDEX.md with links
- [ ] HTML report generation
- [ ] Output comparison tools

### Phase 5: Optimization
**Goal**: Performance and scalability

#### Task 5.1: Performance Improvements
- [ ] Caching for expensive operations
- [ ] Parallel execution where possible
- [ ] Resource usage monitoring
- [ ] Performance benchmarking

#### Task 5.2: Agent Communication
- [ ] Unified agent interface
- [ ] Message queue for communication
- [ ] Result standardization
- [ ] Parallel agent execution

### Phase 6: Polish
**Goal**: Production-ready system

#### Task 6.1: Documentation and Testing
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Integration test suite
- [ ] Mock agents for testing
- [ ] Performance tests

#### Task 6.2: Feedback Learning
- [ ] Feedback database
- [ ] Pattern recognition
