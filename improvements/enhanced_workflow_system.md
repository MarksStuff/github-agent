# Enhanced Multi-Agent Workflow System

## Overview

Transform the current clunky multi-agent workflow into a seamless, resumable, and visual experience with GitHub integration for feedback loops.

## Key Requirements

- **Idempotent**: Can resume from any failure point
- **GitHub Integration**: Auto-commit, push, and wait for feedback
- **Visual Progress**: Rich CLI output and web dashboard
- **State Management**: Persistent state across runs
- **User Interaction**: Pause points for review and feedback

## Architecture

```
workflow.py
├── WorkflowState (persistent state)
├── StageOrchestrator (pipeline management)
├── GitHubIntegrator (commits, feedback)
├── OutputManager (CLI + web dashboard)
└── Agent interfaces (existing agents)
```
