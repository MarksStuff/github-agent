# Task Breakdown: Symbol Type Information Feature

## Executive Summary & Key Decisions Needed

This feature implements semantic type information retrieval to replace grep-based code discovery, targeting **95-99% token reduction** for AI agents. Based on estimation insights, we're balancing fast delivery with architectural quality to avoid technical debt.

### 🔥 Critical Decisions for Review
1. **Performance SLA**: Should we target <200ms response time from day 1, or start with <2s and optimize?
2. **Architecture Approach**: Start with `inspect` module + simple caching, or implement full LSP integration immediately?
3. **Scope**: Focus on 80% common cases first, or address complex type scenarios (generics, inheritance) upfront?
4. **Deployment Strategy**: Ship MVP and iterate, or build comprehensive solution before release?

## Task Breakdown

### 🚀 Phase 1: Quick Wins & Foundation (3-4 days)

#### Task 1.1: Performance Baseline & Validation Spike
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Validates core assumption
**Estimate**: 0.5 days

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Benchmark current LSP type query response times on 3 representative repositories
- [ ] Document baseline: avg/p95 response times for `hover`, `definition`, `typeDefinition` requests
- [ ] Validate <200ms target is achievable with existing LSP infrastructure
- [ ] Test LSP server stability under concurrent type queries

**Risk Mitigation**: Addresses "Performance Baseline" assumption - need concrete data before committing to SLAs

**Implementation Notes**:
```python
# Benchmark script to measure LSP query times
def benchmark_lsp_performance():
    # Test hover, definition, typeDefinition on various symbol types
    # Measure response times across different file sizes
    # Document LSP server resource usage
```

**Review Questions**:
- Should we benchmark against multiple LSP servers (pyright vs pylsp)?
- What's acceptable performance degradation under load?

---

#### Task 1.2: Python Inspect Module Integration
**Priority**: HIGH - Leverages quick-win opportunity
**Estimate**: 1 day

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Implement `get_basic_type_info()` using Python's `inspect` module
- [ ] Extract function signatures, parameter types, return annotations
- [ ] Handle class hierarchy (MRO, base classes, methods)
- [ ] Support for both runtime and static analysis scenarios
- [ ] 90% test coverage on common Python constructs

**Quick-Win Leverage**: Uses built-in Python capabilities without LSP complexity

**Implementation Notes**:
```python
def get_basic_type_info(symbol_name: str, module_path: str) -> TypeInfo:
    """Fast type info using inspect module"""
    # Import module dynamically
    # Use inspect.signature(), inspect.getmembers()
    # Handle classes with inspect.getmro()
    # Fallback gracefully when inspection fails
```

**Dependencies**: None - can work independently

---

#### Task 1.3: Simple Caching Layer
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Performance optimization
**Estimate**: 0.5 days

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] In-memory LRU cache for type information (1000 entries)
- [ ] Cache key: (symbol_name, file_path, file_mtime)
- [ ] Cache hit rate >80% for repeated queries
- [ ] Memory usage <50MB for typical workloads

**Risk Mitigation**: Addresses caching performance concerns without over-engineering

**Implementation Notes**:
```python
from functools import lru_cache
from typing import Dict, Optional

@lru_cache(maxsize=1000)
def cached_type_info(symbol_name: str, file_hash: str) -> Optional[TypeInfo]:
    # Simple caching with file hash for invalidation
```

---

### 🔧 Phase 2: LSP Integration & Enhancement (2-3 days)

#### Task 2.1: LSP Type Query Integration
**Priority**: HIGH - Core functionality
**Estimate**: 1.5 days

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Integrate with existing LSP client architecture
- [ ] Implement `lsp_get_type_info()` using hover + typeDefinition requests
- [ ] Parse LSP responses into structured TypeInfo objects
- [ ] Handle LSP errors gracefully (reuse 70+ error codes pattern)
- [ ] Support for both pyright and pylsp servers

**Risk Mitigation**: Reuses established LSP patterns to reduce integration complexity

**Implementation Notes**:
```python
async def lsp_get_type_info(symbol: str, position: Position) -> TypeInfo:
    # Use existing LSP client connection pool
    # Send hover + typeDefinition requests
    # Parse markdown responses into structured data
    # Handle LSP server differences (pyright vs pylsp)
```

**Dependencies**: Requires existing LSP infrastructure

---

#### Task 2.2: Hybrid Approach Implementation
**Priority**: HIGH - Architecture decision
**Estimate**: 1 day

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Implement fallback chain: inspect → LSP → basic text analysis
- [ ] Performance routing: use inspect for runtime info, LSP for static analysis
- [ ] Merge results from multiple sources intelligently
- [ ] Document which approach works best for different scenarios

**Risk Mitigation**: Provides robustness against single-point-of-failure

**Implementation Notes**:
```python
def get_type_info(symbol: str, context: AnalysisContext) -> TypeInfo:
    # Try inspect module first (fast path)
    # Fall back to LSP for static analysis
    # Combine results for comprehensive view
    # Log which method provided the information
```

---

### 🎯 Phase 3: Advanced Features & Optimization (2-3 days)

#### Task 3.1: Complex Type Scenario Handling
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Addresses domain expert concerns
**Estimate**: 1.5 days

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Handle Python generics (`List[str]`, `Dict[str, Any]`)
- [ ] Support inheritance relationships and method resolution order
- [ ] Dynamic typing scenarios (duck typing, `Any` types)
- [ ] Protocol and abstract base class support
- [ ] Type union and optional handling

**Risk Mitigation**: Addresses business domain complexity to avoid architectural debt

**Review Questions**:
- Should this be in Phase 1 to avoid rework, or can we ship without it?
- Which complex scenarios are most critical for user workflows?

---

#### Task 3.2: Performance Optimization & Monitoring
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Long-term sustainability
**Estimate**: 1 day

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Implement request batching for multiple symbol queries
- [ ] Add performance metrics collection (response times, cache hit rates)
- [ ] Optimize cache eviction strategy based on usage patterns
- [ ] Connection pooling for LSP servers if not already present
- [ ] Performance regression tests

**Implementation Notes**:
```python
class TypeInfoMetrics:
    def record_query_time(self, duration_ms: int):
        # Track P95, P99 response times
    def record_cache_hit_rate(self, hit_rate: float):
        # Monitor cache effectiveness
```

---

### 🧪 Phase 4: Integration & Testing (1-2 days)

**Priority**: HIGH - User-facing interface
**Estimate**: 0.5 days

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Implement `get_type_info` MCP tool with proper schema

    # Route to appropriate repository
    # Call type analysis chain
    # Format response for MCP protocol
    return {
        "symbol": symbol,
        "signature": "...",
        "type_info": {...},
        "source": "inspect|lsp|fallback"
    }
```

---

#### Task 4.2: End-to-End Testing
**Priority**: HIGH - Quality assurance
**Estimate**: 1 day

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Test against 3 different Python repositories (Django, FastAPI, data science)
- [ ] Validate token reduction claims with before/after comparisons
- [ ] Performance testing under various load scenarios
- [ ] Integration testing with existing MCP server infrastructure
