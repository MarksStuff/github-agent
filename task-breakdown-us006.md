# MCP Codebase Intelligence Server - Task Breakdown for Symbol Type Information

## Executive Summary

This task breakdown creates a **Symbol Type Information** feature for the MCP Codebase Intelligence Server, focusing on Python type analysis and signatures. Based on estimation insights, we're balancing **technical robustness** (testing-first approach) with **business integration needs** (domain expert concerns).

### Key Decisions Needed üìã
- **Platform Integration Strategy**: Custom MCP compliance infrastructure vs leverage existing tools?
- **Performance SLA Definition**: What are acceptable response times for type queries?
- **Privacy/Security Requirements**: Any specific constraints for code analysis data?
- **Testing Depth**: Full edge case coverage vs MVP with core functionality?

### Approach
Starting with **technical spike to validate assumptions**, then building **robust core functionality** with **incremental business integration**. Leveraging existing Python type analysis libraries for quick wins while addressing platform integration unknowns early.

### üèóÔ∏è **CORE-1: Python Type Analysis Engine**
**Points: 2 | Priority: High | Dependencies: SPIKE-1**

**Objective**: Build robust Python type analysis using existing libraries (quick-win leverage).

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Integration with `mypy` for static type analysis
- [ ] AST parsing for type hint extraction
- [ ] Function signature parsing with parameter types
- [ ] Class hierarchy analysis (base classes, methods)
- [ ] Variable type inference from context
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling for malformed code
- [ ] Performance benchmarks (<200ms for typical queries)

**Quick-Win Leverage**:
- Use `mypy` type analysis instead of building custom inference
- Leverage `typing-extensions` for advanced type support
- Use AST tools for reliable parsing

**Implementation Notes**:
```python
class PythonTypeAnalyzer:
    def get_symbol_type_info(self, symbol: str, file_path: str) -> TypeInfo:
        # Leverage mypy for type analysis
        # Parse AST for signature extraction
        # Handle error cases gracefully
```

**Risk Mitigation**: Addresses "Parsing & Analysis Failures" through comprehensive error handling.
