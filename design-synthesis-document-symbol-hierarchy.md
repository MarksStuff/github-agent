# Design Synthesis: Document Symbol Hierarchy

## 1. Universal Agreements
*Core technical decisions that ALL agents explicitly agree on*

- **Core Implementation**: Use of the `SimpleLSPClient` class to handle LSP communication with pylsp
- **Key Components**: `get_document_symbols()` method in `SimpleLSPClient`, `document_symbols()` handler in `CodebaseTools`, and `TOOL_HANDLERS` mapping
- **Integration Points**: Integration with MCP endpoint through `CodebaseTools`, and testing via `MockLSPClient`

## 2. Concrete Architectural Divergences

### Divergence 1: LSP Process Management
**The Actual Choice:**
- **Option A** (Senior-Engineer, Fast-Coder): Spawn fresh pylsp process for each request
  - Impact: Simpler implementation with no shared state, but higher resource usage and potential performance overhead
- **Option B** (Architect): Use connection pooling with existing LSP process
  - Impact: More efficient resource usage, but requires managing state and potential connection issues

**Decision Required Because:** The choice between stateless and stateful LSP communication impacts performance, resource usage, and implementation complexity

### Divergence 2: Symbol Kind Conversion
**The Actual Choice:**
- **Option A** (Senior-Engineer, Fast-Coder): Convert LSP symbol kinds from integers to readable strings
  - Impact: User-friendly output, but requires maintaining a mapping between integers and strings
- **Option B** (Architect): Return raw integer symbol kinds
  - Impact: Less user-friendly, but avoids maintaining a conversion mapping

**Decision Required Because:** The choice between raw integer values and human-readable strings affects the usability and clarity of the output

### Divergence 3: Hierarchical Structure Handling
**The Actual Choice:**
- **Option A** (Senior-Engineer, Fast-Coder): Process hierarchical structure recursively to maintain parent-child relationships
  - Impact: Accurate representation of code structure, but requires careful recursion handling
- **Option B** (Architect): Flatten the symbol structure for simplicity
  - Impact: Simpler implementation, but loses important nesting information

**Decision Required Because:** The choice between preserving hierarchical relationships and simplifying the structure affects the usefulness of the feature for code navigation

## 3. Implementation Decisions Needed

### Decision 1: Technology/Library Choice
**Question:** Should we use `pylsp` or a custom LSP implementation?
- **Choose pylsp if:** Your priority is leveraging an established, well-supported LSP server
- **Choose custom if:** Your priority is full control over LSP behavior and minimal external dependencies
- **For this codebase:** Use `pylsp` as it's already integrated and provides the required capabilities

### Decision 2: Scope Decision
**Question:** Should we implement basic symbol retrieval or include advanced features like filtering and search?
- **Minimal:** Only basic symbol retrieval with hierarchical structure
- **Expanded:** Include filtering, search, and metadata enhancements
- **For this feature:** Implement basic symbol retrieval with hierarchical structure as the MVP, with room for future expansion

### Decision 3: Integration Pattern
**Question:** Should we refactor existing `CodebaseTools` or add a new module?
- **Refactor if:** You want to maintain a unified codebase and avoid duplication
- **Add new if:** You want to keep existing code stable and avoid potential breaking changes
- **For this codebase:** Add a new module for symbol handling to avoid modifying existing `CodebaseTools` and maintain stability
