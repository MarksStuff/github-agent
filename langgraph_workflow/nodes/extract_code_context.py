You have FULL ACCESS to the repository code. Analyze it thoroughly to create a Code Context Document.

## Repository to Analyze:
{repo_path}

## ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY:

### Phase 1: Code Examination (DO THIS FIRST)
Before making any claims, examine:

1. **Entry Points & Main Files**
   - Locate main.py, index.js, app.py, main.go, or equivalent
   - Identify how the application starts and initializes
   - Trace the execution flow from entry point

2. **Core Business Logic**
   - Find the primary domain models/entities
   - Identify key business operations and workflows
   - Look for service/controller/handler layers

3. **Actual Dependencies Used**
   - Check import statements in source files (not just package.json/requirements.txt)
   - Identify which frameworks are actually instantiated and used
   - Distinguish between installed vs. actually utilized dependencies

4. **Architecture Verification**
   - Examine actual class hierarchies and module dependencies
   - Look at how components communicate (direct calls, events, queues, etc.)
   - Identify real design patterns in the code (not just file naming)

5. **Data Layer Analysis**
   - Find actual database connections and queries
   - Identify ORM usage or raw SQL
   - Look for data models and schemas

### Phase 2: Document Creation

Based on your ACTUAL CODE EXAMINATION, create a Code Context Document with:

## 1. SYSTEM IDENTITY
**What This System Actually Does:**
- Primary purpose (based on core business logic found)
- Problem domain (based on domain models and operations)
- System type (web app/API/CLI tool/library based on entry points)

*Evidence: Quote specific files/classes that prove this*

## 2. ARCHITECTURE REALITY CHECK

**Actual Architecture Pattern:**
Look at the code structure and answer:
- Is this actually MVC? (Show me the Models, Views, Controllers)
- Is this actually microservices? (Show me service boundaries and communication)
- Is this actually event-driven? (Show me event publishers/subscribers)
- Is this actually layered? (Show me the layer boundaries and dependencies)

*Evidence: Reference specific code structures*

**Real Design Patterns Found:**
For each pattern claimed:
- Pattern name
- Where it's implemented (specific files/classes)
- Code example showing the pattern

## 3. TECHNOLOGY STACK - VERIFIED USAGE

**Primary Language(s):**
- Language: [language]
- Actual usage: List 3-5 core files written in this language
- Purpose: What aspects of the system use this language

**Frameworks ACTUALLY IN USE:**
For each framework:
- Framework name
- Initialization/configuration location (specific file:line)
- How it's used (with code example)
- Why it's essential (what breaks if removed)

**Database/Storage:**
- Type (found in connection strings/configs)
- Access method (ORM/driver found in code)
- Schema location or model definitions

## 4. CODE ORGANIZATION ANALYSIS

**Directory Structure Meaning:**
```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [directory]/ - {{what you found this contains after examining files}}
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [directory]/ - {{actual purpose based on code inspection}}
```

**Module Communication Patterns:**
- How do modules actually reference each other?
- What are the dependency directions?
- Are there circular dependencies?

## 5. KEY COMPONENTS AND THEIR ROLES

For each major component found:
- **Component**: [Name]
- **Location**: [Path]
- **Responsibility**: [What it actually does based on its code]
- **Dependencies**: [What it imports/uses]
- **Dependents**: [What uses it]

## 6. INTEGRATION POINTS - VERIFIED

**External Systems:**
- API clients found (with initialization code locations)
- External services called (with example calls)
- Message queues/event buses (with connection code)

**Exposed Interfaces:**
- REST endpoints (with route definitions)
- GraphQL schemas (with resolver locations)
- CLI commands (with command definitions)
- Library exports (with public API surface)

## 7. DATA FLOW ANALYSIS

Trace a typical operation through the system:
1. Entry point: [file:function]
2. Validation: [file:function]
3. Business logic: [file:function]
4. Data access: [file:function]
5. Response: [file:function]

## 8. TESTING REALITY

**Test Coverage:**
- Test files location
- Testing framework (based on imports in test files)
- Types of tests found (unit/integration/e2e)
- Key test examples

## 9. DEVELOPMENT PRACTICES - OBSERVED

Based on code examination:
- **Code Style**: Observed conventions (not just linter configs)
- **Error Handling**: Patterns actually used in code
- **Logging**: Framework and patterns found
- **Configuration**: How config is actually loaded and used

## 10. CRITICAL FINDINGS

**Code Smells/Issues Found:**
- [Issue] in [location]
- [Technical debt] in [component]

**Inconsistencies:**
- Different patterns in [location] vs [location]
- Mixed conventions between [module] and [module]


## VALIDATION CHECKLIST

Before finalizing, verify:
- [ ] Every framework listed is actually imported and used in source code
- [ ] Every pattern claimed has a concrete code example
- [ ] Every component described exists in the repository
- [ ] Architecture description matches actual code structure
- [ ] No languages listed that only appear in config/data files
- [ ] Integration points have actual code implementing them

## IMPORTANT RULES:

1. **NO HALLUCINATION**: Only describe what you can point to in the code
2. **SHOW EVIDENCE**: Every claim must reference specific files/code
3. **ACKNOWLEDGE UNKNOWNS**: If something isn't clear from the code, say so
4. **VERIFY CLAIMS**: Cross-check findings across multiple files
5. **ACTUAL vs INTENDED**: Describe what the code DOES, not what comments say it should do

Remember: You have the actual code. Read it. Don't guess based on file names or metadata.""",
