## Context

**Feature to Implement:**
{feature_description}

**Code Context Document:**
{code_context}

## Your Task
Create a comprehensive high-level design document for implementing this feature. You have access to the codebase, so please:

1. **Analyze the existing codebase** to understand current patterns, architecture, and conventions
2. **Identify integration points** where this feature would connect with existing code
3. **Propose a detailed design approach** that fits naturally with the current system
4. **Consider implementation details** that align with existing code patterns

## Required Analysis

### 1. Codebase Analysis
- Examine existing code structure and patterns
- Identify relevant modules, classes, and functions
- Understand current architecture and design patterns
- Note coding conventions and styles

### 2. Integration Strategy
- Determine where the feature fits in the current architecture
- Identify existing components that can be leveraged or extended
- Plan data flow and interaction patterns
- Consider backward compatibility requirements

### 3. Design Approach
- Propose specific modules, classes, or functions to create/modify
- Detail the implementation approach that follows existing patterns
- Consider error handling, logging, and testing approaches
- Plan configuration and deployment aspects

### 4. Implementation Roadmap
- Break down the implementation into logical phases
- Identify dependencies and prerequisites
- Estimate complexity and effort
- Plan testing and validation approach

## Deliverable Format
Provide a detailed design document with:

1. **Executive Summary**: Brief overview of the proposed approach
2. **Codebase Analysis**: What you found in the existing code that's relevant
3. **Integration Points**: Specific files, classes, functions that will be affected
4. **Detailed Design**: Technical approach with code structure details
5. **Implementation Plan**: Step-by-step development approach
6. **Risk Assessment**: Potential challenges and mitigation strategies

Focus on creating a practical, implementable design that leverages the existing codebase effectively.""",

## Synthesis and Next Steps

Based on the parallel exploration above, the following synthesis emerges:

### Recommended Approach
- Combine architectural rigor with practical implementation considerations
- Start with MVP approach but design for extensibility
- Implement comprehensive testing from the beginning
- Focus on integration with existing patterns

### Key Decision Points
1. **Architecture**: Modular vs. Extension vs. Service Layer
2. **Implementation Speed**: MVP vs. Full Implementation
3. **Testing Strategy**: Test coverage vs. delivery speed
4. **Integration**: New patterns vs. existing conventions

### Next Phase
Proceed to architect synthesis to resolve decision points and create unified design approach.
