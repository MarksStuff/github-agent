# Enhanced Multi-Agent Workflow

A comprehensive two-phase development workflow that orchestrates 4 AI agents to design, implement, and maintain high-quality code through skeleton-first architecture and test-driven development.

## Overview

This enhanced workflow implements a sophisticated development process:

1. **Skeleton-First Design**: Architecture skeleton created before any implementation
2. **Test-First Development**: Comprehensive tests written against the skeleton  
3. **Blind Implementation**: Code implemented without seeing tests
4. **Iterative Validation**: Test failures analyzed and fixed systematically
5. **Automated PR Management**: GitHub PR creation, review, and response cycles

## Workflow Phases

### Phase 1: Design Analysis & Architecture Skeleton

1. **Design Analysis**: All 4 agents analyze the feature requirements
2. **Skeleton Creation**: Architect creates complete class/method signatures  
3. **Skeleton Review**: All agents review the architecture skeleton
4. **Finalization**: Senior engineer incorporates feedback and finalizes skeleton

### Phase 2: Test Creation & Review

1. **Test Creation**: Testing agent creates comprehensive test suite against skeleton
2. **Test Review**: All agents review tests for coverage and quality
3. **Test Finalization**: Senior engineer addresses feedback and finalizes tests

### Phase 3: Implementation & Test Validation

1. **Blind Implementation**: Developer implements all methods without seeing tests
2. **Test Execution**: Run all tests and capture detailed failure information
3. **Failure Analysis**: Each agent analyzes failures and suggests fixes
4. **Fix Planning**: Senior engineer creates comprehensive fix plan
5. **Fix Application**: Apply fixes and re-run tests
6. **Iteration**: Repeat until all tests pass (max 5 iterations)
7. **Git Operations**: Commit all changes and push to repository
8. **PR Creation**: Create GitHub Pull Request
9. **Workflow Pause**: Wait for human review

### Phase 4: PR Review & Response Cycles

1. **Resume Signal**: Human resumes workflow after PR review
2. **Comment Fetching**: Retrieve new PR comments via MCP GitHub tools
3. **Comment Analysis**: All agents analyze comments and suggest responses
4. **Response Planning**: Senior engineer creates response plan
5. **Implementation**: Make code changes and post PR replies
6. **Commit Changes**: Commit response changes with summary
7. **Pause & Repeat**: Pause for next review cycle

## Usage

### Starting a New Workflow

```bash
# Basic usage
python run_enhanced_workflow.py my-org/my-repo . "Feature Name" "Detailed description"

# Example
python run_enhanced_workflow.py github-org/my-app . "User Authentication" "Add JWT-based authentication with login/logout endpoints"
```

### Resuming After PR Review

```bash
# Resume paused workflow
python run_enhanced_workflow.py my-org/my-repo . --resume
```

### Checking Workflow Status

```bash
# View current status
python run_enhanced_workflow.py my-org/my-repo . --status
```

## Workflow States

The workflow maintains persistent state in `.workflow/workflow_state.json`:

- **design**: Phase 1 - Creating architecture skeleton
- **tests**: Phase 2 - Creating and reviewing test suite  
- **implementation**: Phase 3 - Implementation and test validation
- **pr_review**: Phase 4 - PR review and response cycles
- **completed**: Workflow finished successfully
