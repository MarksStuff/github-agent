# Multi-Agent Code Collaboration System Design

## Problem Statement

Software development benefits from diverse perspectives - architectural vision, implementation expertise, senior engineering judgment, and testing rigor. However, coordinating these different viewpoints effectively is challenging, often leading to:

- **Sequential bias**: Early decisions by one role constraining later input from others
- **Siloed expertise**: Each role working independently without cross-pollination of ideas
- **Inconsistent quality**: Variable application of best practices across features
- **Poor traceability**: Difficulty understanding why certain implementation decisions were made

We want to create a system where multiple AI coding agents (representing different software engineering roles) can collaborate iteratively on feature development, while maintaining human oversight and decision-making authority.

## Assumptions

### Technical Assumptions
- Four distinct agent personas: Architect, Developer, Senior Engineer, and Tester
- Each agent exposes a consistent API for task execution and code modification
- GitHub repository serves as the collaboration workspace
- GitHub API access for reading PR comments and posting responses
- Text-based communication between agents using markdown files

### Process Assumptions
- Features are broken down into substantial tasks (not micro-tasks)
- Human reviewer has final authority at key decision points
- All collaboration artifacts should be preserved for future reference
- Agents should understand and respect existing codebase patterns
- Iterative refinement produces better outcomes than sequential handoffs

### Scope Assumptions
- System focuses on feature implementation (not bug fixes or maintenance)
- Agents work within existing architectural constraints
- Human provides strategic direction; agents handle tactical execution
- One feature/task processed at a time per workflow instance

## High-Level Proposed Design

### Core Architecture

The system orchestrates four specialized AI agents through a structured, iterative workflow with human feedback gates. All collaboration occurs within a single GitHub Pull Request, creating a complete historical record of decision-making and implementation.

### Key Components

1. **WorkflowOrchestrator**: Central coordinator managing the collaboration process
2. **Agent Interfaces**: Standardized APIs for the four specialist agents
3. **GitHub Integration**: Bidirectional communication with GitHub for feedback and responses
4. **Context Management**: Maintains shared state and decision history
5. **Human Feedback Processing**: Integrates human input at strategic points

### Collaboration Model

- **Round-based iterations** with concurrent agent input to eliminate ordering bias
- **GitHub-native feedback** using PR comments for both code and documentation
- **Unified artifact storage** keeping all decisions, code, and reasoning in one place
- **Human gate controls** at critical decision points

## Detailed Design of All Components

## Resulting Workflow (User Perspective)

### Initial Setup

1. **Define Feature Task**
   - Create a task specification file with requirements, user stories, acceptance criteria
   - Specify any architectural constraints or preferences
   - Identify affected system components

2. **Execute Step-by-Step Workflow**
   - The workflow is now broken into discrete steps for better control and review
   - Each step builds on the previous, with clear checkpoints

### Step 1: Multi-Agent Analysis

**Command**: `python step1_analysis.py task_spec.md`

**What Happens**:
- All four agents simultaneously analyze the task requirements and codebase context
- Each agent produces their specialized analysis document
- Documents are committed to `.workflow/round_1_analysis/` in the PR

**Deliverables in PR**:
- `architect_analysis.md` - System design considerations and integration points
- `developer_analysis.md` - Implementation approach and technology choices
- `senior_engineer_analysis.md` - Performance and technical quality concerns
- `tester_analysis.md` - Testing strategy and edge case identification

**Human Review**:
- Review all four analysis documents in GitHub PR
- Provide feedback via PR comments on any concerns or preferences
- No explicit approval needed - proceed to Step 2 when ready

### Step 2: Create Design Document

**Command**: `python step2_create_design_document.py --pr <number>`

**What Happens**:
- Agents review each other's analyses from Step 1
- Identify and resolve conflicting approaches
- Generate a consolidated design document with implementation details
- Document is committed to `.workflow/round_2_design/` in the PR

**Deliverables**:
- `peer_reviews.md` - Cross-agent analysis reviews
- `conflict_resolution.md` - How conflicts were resolved
- `consolidated_design.md` - Unified technical design ready for implementation

**Human Review**:
- Review the consolidated design document
- Check that all requirements are addressed
- Provide feedback via GitHub PR comments on the design

### Step 3: Finalize Design with Feedback

**Command**: `python step3_finalize_design_document.py --pr <number>`

**What Happens**:
- System reads all GitHub PR comments on the design
- Categorizes feedback (architecture, implementation, testing, etc.)
- Updates the design document to address all feedback
- Creates a finalized version incorporating all improvements

**Deliverables**:
- `consolidated_design_final.md` - Updated design addressing all feedback
- `feedback_addressed.md` - Summary of feedback and changes made

**Human Review**:
- Verify all feedback has been properly addressed
- Approve the final design for implementation
- No code changes yet - this is still design phase

### Step 4: Interactive Development Process

**Command**: `python step4_implementation.py --pr <number>`

**Overview**: Implementation follows a structured 4-part cycle for each task identified in the finalized design document. This ensures quality, incorporates multiple perspectives, and allows for human feedback at each stage.

#### Part 1: Interactive Coding Session

**What Happens**:
- **Human-Developer Collaboration**: Interactive coding session where human and developer agent work together
- **Real-time Implementation**: Code is written iteratively with immediate feedback
- **Task-focused Approach**: Each implementation task from the design gets its own session
- **Source Authority**: Only the finalized design document and existing code are used as references

**Process**:
1. Load the specific task from `finalized_design.md`
2. Start interactive session with developer agent
3. Implement code with real-time human guidance and approval
4. Focus on one discrete task at a time (as defined in design)
5. Commit the implemented code with descriptive message

#### Part 2: Multi-Agent Review and Refinement

**What Happens**:
- **Offline Review Process**: Other personas (Architect, Senior Engineer, Tester) review the implemented code
- **Automated Refinement**: Each agent provides feedback and suggested improvements
- **Iterative Improvement**: Code is refined based on multi-perspective feedback
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensures code meets standards for architecture, quality, and testing

**Process**:
1. **Architect Review**: System integration, design compliance, architectural patterns
2. **Senior Engineer Review**: Code quality, maintainability, performance considerations  
3. **Tester Review**: Test coverage, edge cases, quality assurance
4. **Code Refinement**: Apply accepted suggestions and improvements
5. **Commit Refined Code**: Commit with message summarizing review changes

#### Part 3: Human Review Break

**What Happens**:
- **PR Comment Opportunity**: Human reviews the implemented code via GitHub PR
- **Feedback Collection**: Human provides comments on specific lines, files, or overall approach
- **Quality Gate**: Ensures human approval before proceeding to integration

**Process**:
1. Human reviews commits from Parts 1 & 2 in GitHub PR interface
2. Add PR comments on any concerns, suggestions, or approval
3. System pauses until human feedback is provided
4. No automated changes during this phase - pure human review time

#### Part 4: PR Comment Integration

**What Happens**:
- **Feedback Integration**: System reads and processes all PR comments on the implemented code
- **Code Updates**: Developer agent updates code based on human feedback
- **Final Refinement**: Incorporate human suggestions while maintaining design compliance
- **Completion**: Task is marked complete with all feedback addressed

**Process**:
1. **Comment Analysis**: Parse and categorize PR comments on the implementation
2. **Code Updates**: Developer agent modifies code to address feedback
3. **Validation**: Ensure changes still comply with design document
4. **Final Commit**: Commit integrated changes with summary of feedback addressed
5. **Comment Replies**: Post replies to PR comments explaining how they were addressed

#### Task-by-Task Implementation

**Multi-Task Handling**: If the design document contains multiple implementation tasks, each task goes through all 4 parts before moving to the next:

```
Task 1: Part 1 → Part 2 → Part 3 → Part 4 → Commit
Task 2: Part 1 → Part 2 → Part 3 → Part 4 → Commit  
Task 3: Part 1 → Part 2 → Part 3 → Part 4 → Commit
...
```

**Commit Strategy**: Each part that makes changes creates its own commit:
- **Part 1**: "Implement [task]: Interactive coding session"
- **Part 2**: "Refine [task]: Multi-agent review improvements" 
- **Part 4**: "Update [task]: Integrate PR feedback"

This creates a clear audit trail showing how code evolved through collaborative refinement.

#### Benefits of the 4-Part Cycle

**Human-Centric**: Interactive coding ensures human intent is captured correctly from the start

**Multi-Perspective Quality**: Every piece of code gets reviewed by multiple specialized agents

**Continuous Feedback**: Human can provide input at natural breakpoints in the process

**Traceable Evolution**: Git commits show exactly how code improved through collaboration

**Design Fidelity**: Process ensures implementation stays true to approved design

### Workflow Summary

The complete workflow consists of four discrete steps:

1. **Step 1: Analysis** → Multi-agent analysis of requirements
2. **Step 2: Design** → Consolidated design document creation  
3. **Step 3: Finalize** → Incorporate GitHub feedback into design
4. **Step 4: Implementation** → Generate code based on finalized design

Each step:
- Has its own command-line script
- Produces specific deliverables
- Allows for human review and feedback
- Builds on the previous step's outputs

### Benefits of the 4-Step Approach

**Better Control**: Each step can be run independently, allowing for:
- Partial workflows (e.g., just analysis and design)
- Easy restart from any step
- Clear checkpoints for review

**Improved Feedback Loop**: 
- Step 3 explicitly incorporates GitHub feedback before any code is written
- Ensures design is fully approved before implementation
- Reduces wasted effort on incorrect implementations

**Cleaner Separation**:
- Analysis (Step 1) focuses on understanding
- Design (Steps 2-3) focuses on planning
- Implementation (Step 4) focuses on execution

### Quick Start Guide

```bash
# Step 1: Analyze the task
python step1_analysis.py my_feature_spec.md

# Step 2: Create consolidated design (uses PR number from step 1)
python step2_create_design_document.py --pr 123

# Step 3: Finalize design with GitHub feedback
python step3_finalize_design_document.py --pr 123

# Step 4: Implement based on finalized design
python step4_implementation.py --pr 123
```

### Post-Implementation

**Deliverables in PR**:
- All workflow artifacts in `.workflow/` directory
- Generated code with comprehensive tests
- Complete audit trail of decisions and reasoning
- GitHub PR ready for final review and merge

## Workflow Recovery and Resilience

### Recovery Scenarios

**1. System Crash During Round Execution**
```bash
# Detect interrupted workflow
python orchestrator.py list-incomplete-workflows
# Output: PR #123 (user-auth-v2) - Interrupted during Round 3, Iteration 2

# Resume from last checkpoint
python orchestrator.py resume-workflow --pr 123
# System detects phase, restores context, continues from interruption point
```

**2. Agent API Failure Mid-Process**
```bash
# Manual intervention when agent becomes unavailable
python orchestrator.py pause-workflow --pr 123 --reason "developer_agent_down"

# Resume when agent is restored
python orchestrator.py resume-workflow --pr 123 --skip-validation
```

**3. Corrupted Workflow State**
```bash
# Reconstruct state from PR artifacts
python orchestrator.py repair-workflow --pr 123
# Analyzes PR contents to rebuild workflow state
# Reports: "Detected: Round 2 complete, Round 3 in progress"

# Resume with reconstructed state
python orchestrator.py resume-workflow --pr 123 --use-repaired-state
```

### Automatic Recovery Features

**Checkpoint Creation**:
- Before each round begins
- After human feedback processing
- Before major code changes
- After conflict resolution

**State Validation**:
- Verify agent availability before resuming
- Check PR integrity and accessibility
- Validate context consistency
- Confirm GitHub API connectivity

**Progressive Recovery**:
- First attempt: Resume from exact interruption point
- Fallback: Restart current round with preserved context
- Final fallback: Manual recovery with user guidance

### Recovery Commands

**Status and Discovery**:
```bash
# List all incomplete workflows
orchestrator.py list-incomplete

# Get detailed status of specific workflow
orchestrator.py status --pr 123

# Show available recovery options
orchestrator.py recovery-options --pr 123
```

**Recovery Operations**:
```bash
# Simple resume (auto-detect state)
orchestrator.py resume --pr 123

# Resume from specific checkpoint
orchestrator.py resume --pr 123 --from-checkpoint round_2_complete

# Resume with state repair
orchestrator.py resume --pr 123 --repair-state

# Rollback to earlier phase
orchestrator.py rollback --pr 123 --to-phase round_1_analysis
```

**Manual Interventions**:
```bash
# Force workflow to specific state
orchestrator.py set-phase --pr 123 --phase round_3_implementation

# Skip problematic round
orchestrator.py skip-round --pr 123 --round round_2_design

# Emergency reset (preserves artifacts)
orchestrator.py reset-workflow --pr 123 --preserve-artifacts
```

**Monitoring Progress**:
- Check PR for current status and any pending reviews
- Respond to agent questions via GitHub comments
- Approve progression through workflow gates

**Emergency Interventions**:
- Comment `@agents pause` to halt workflow
- Comment `@agents restart-round` to redo current phase
- Direct message specific agents: `@architect please reconsider the database design`

This workflow provides structured collaboration while maintaining your strategic control and leveraging GitHub's familiar interface for all human-agent interactions.

## Integration with Existing MCP Server

The parent directory contains a fully functional MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides the GitHub integration tools we need for the agent collaboration workflow. Here's how to integrate the existing components:

### Available GitHub Tools from MCP Server

The MCP server (in `../github_tools.py`) provides these essential tools:

1. **`github_get_pr_comments`** - Retrieves all review comments from a PR
   - Automatically finds PR for current branch if pr_number not provided
   - Returns comment details including ID, author, content, and thread structure
   - Essential for GitHubFeedbackReader component

2. **`github_post_pr_reply`** - Posts replies to specific PR comments
   - Takes comment_id and message
   - Supports GitHub Markdown formatting
   - Used by GitHubResponseWriter component

3. **`github_get_build_status`** - Gets CI/CD status for commits
   - Shows overall build state and individual check results
   - Critical for validation phases

4. **`github_find_pr_for_branch`** - Finds PR associated with a branch
   - Links local branches to GitHub PRs
   - Enables automatic PR detection

### Agent Personas Implementation

The `coding_personas.py` file provides four distinct agent implementations using the AmpCLI wrapper:

1. **Fast Coder** (`CodingPersonas.fast_coder()`)
   - Focused on rapid iteration and getting code working quickly
   - Maps to DeveloperAgent in our design

2. **Test-Focused Coder** (`CodingPersonas.test_focused_coder()`)
   - Emphasizes TDD and comprehensive testing
   - Maps to TesterAgent in our design

3. **Senior Engineer** (`CodingPersonas.senior_engineer()`)
   - Prioritizes code quality and maintainability
   - Maps to SeniorEngineerAgent in our design

4. **Architect** (`CodingPersonas.architect()`)
   - Ensures architectural integrity and scalability
   - Maps to ArchitectAgent in our design

### Integration Architecture

```python
# Example integration structure

        )
    
    async def post_reply(self, comment_id: int, message: str) -> dict:
        """Post reply using MCP tool"""
        return await execute_tool(
            "github_post_pr_reply",
            comment_id=comment_id,
            message=message
        )

class AgentInterface:
    """Base class wrapping AmpCLI personas"""
    
    def __init__(self, persona_factory):
        self.persona = persona_factory()
    
    async def analyze_task(self, context: dict, round_type: str) -> str:
        prompt = self._build_analysis_prompt(context, round_type)
        return self.persona.ask(prompt)
    
    def _build_analysis_prompt(self, context: dict, round_type: str) -> str:
        # Build context-aware prompt for the persona
        return f"Context: {context}\nAnalyze this task for {round_type}..."

# Concrete agent implementations
class ArchitectAgent(AgentInterface):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(CodingPersonas.architect)

class DeveloperAgent(AgentInterface):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(CodingPersonas.fast_coder)

class SeniorEngineerAgent(AgentInterface):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(CodingPersonas.senior_engineer)

class TesterAgent(AgentInterface):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(CodingPersonas.test_focused_coder)
```

### Workflow Orchestrator Integration

```python
class WorkflowOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self, repo_name: str):
        self.repo_name = repo_name
        self.github = GitHubIntegration(repo_name)
        self.agents = {
            'architect': ArchitectAgent(),
            'developer': DeveloperAgent(),
            'senior_engineer': SeniorEngineerAgent(),
            'tester': TesterAgent()
        }
    
    async def execute_feature_task(self, task_spec: str):
        # Find or create PR
        current_branch = await self._get_current_branch()
        pr_data = await execute_tool(
            "github_find_pr_for_branch",
            repo_name=self.repo_name,
            branch_name=current_branch
        )
        
        if not pr_data:
            pr_number = await self._create_pr(task_spec)
        else:
            pr_number = pr_data['number']
        
        # Start workflow with PR context
        await self._run_workflow(pr_number, task_spec)
```

### Running the MCP Server

The MCP server needs to be running to provide the GitHub tools:

```bash
# Start the MCP server (from parent directory)
python mcp_worker.py myorg/myrepo /path/to/repo

# The server will provide tools at the MCP endpoint
# Our workflow orchestrator connects to this server
```

### Key Implementation Details

1. **Tool Execution**: Use `execute_tool()` from `github_tools.py` to call MCP tools
2. **Agent Isolation**: Each persona runs in isolated AmpCLI environment
3. **Async Operations**: All GitHub API calls are async for performance
4. **Error Handling**: MCP tools return structured error responses

### Environment Requirements

- Python 3.12+ (for MCP server)
- GitHub token with appropriate permissions
- AmpCLI installed and configured
- Repository must be accessible locally

## Implementation Strategy

### 4-Step Workflow Architecture

The system has been restructured into four discrete steps, each with its own script and clear deliverables. This provides better control, clearer checkpoints, and improved feedback integration.

### 🎯 **Current Implementation Status**

**Completed Components** ✅:
- ✅ **Step 1: Analysis** - Multi-agent analysis with `step1_analysis.py`
- ✅ **Step 2: Design Creation** - Design consolidation with `step2_create_design_document.py`
- ✅ **Step 3: Design Finalization** - GitHub feedback integration with `step3_finalize_design_document.py`

- Modified without affecting other steps

**Clear Progression**:
1. **Understanding** (Step 1) → What needs to be built
2. **Planning** (Steps 2-3) → How it will be built
3. **Execution** (Step 4) → Actually building it

**Human Control**: Multiple review points ensure:
- Design approval before implementation
- Feedback incorporation before coding
- Quality control at each stage

### Example Workflow Execution

```bash
