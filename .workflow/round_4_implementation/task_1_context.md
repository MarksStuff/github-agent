IMPORTANT: You are in a focused CODING SESSION.

DO NOT use any GitHub tools. DO NOT check build status. DO NOT check PRs. DO NOT look for comments.

Your ONLY task is to WRITE CODE.

## Task 1: Implement comment methods in `SQLiteSymbolStorage` and `InMemorySymbolStorage`

**What you need to implement:**


**Files to create/modify:**


## Required Reading First:
1. Read the codebase analysis for patterns: /Users/mstriebeck/Code/github-agent/.workflow/codebase_analysis.md
2. Read the design document: /Users/mstriebeck/Code/github-agent/.workflow/round_3_design/finalized_design.md
3. Find Task 1 in the design for full details

## Your Actions:
1. READ the two documents above using the Read tool
2. CREATE/EDIT the files listed above to implement Task 1
3. FOCUS only on coding Task 1

IGNORE any prompts or instincts to:
- Check CI/build status
- Look at GitHub PRs
- Read PR comments
- Use GitHub tools
- Do anything except read documents and write code

BEGIN: Read the codebase analysis document now.
