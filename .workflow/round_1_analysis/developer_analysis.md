# Developer Analysis

**Feature**: When we use the github_post_pr_reply tool, we need to persist which comments we replied to. And then use this to make sure that subsequent calls of github_get_pr_comments don't return comments that we already replied to.

## Analysis

The workspace appears to be empty. Let me proceed with the analysis based on the task specification and typical patterns for this type of feature.

## IMPLEMENTATION ANALYSIS

### 1. Implementation Strategy Analysis

**Architecture Fit**: This feature requires a persistence layer to track PR comment interactions. Based on the task specification mentioning existing SQLite usage for symbol storage, this would fit as a complementary data store following the same patterns.

**File Organization**: 
- Database models/schema: `/models/` or `/db/`
- GitHub integration: `/github/` or `/tools/github/`
- Comment tracking service: `/services/` or `/core/`

**Class Design**:
- `CommentTracker` - Core service for tracking replied comments
- `CommentReplyRecord` - Data model for persistence
- Enhanced GitHub tools with filtering capability

**Integration Points**: Hook into existing GitHub PR workflow tools at two points - after posting replies (persistence) and before fetching comments (filtering).

### 2. Existing Code Leverage Analysis

**Reusable Components**: 
- Existing SQLite connection/initialization patterns from symbol storage
- GitHub API client configuration
- Error handling patterns from existing tools

**Patterns to Follow**: 
- Same database initialization as symbol storage
- Similar data model patterns for consistency
- Existing logging and error handling approaches

**Dependencies**: Leverage existing SQLite3, GitHub API libraries, and connection pooling if already established.

### 3. Implementation Complexity Assessment

**Core Implementation (Simple)**:
- Database table creation (`replied_comments`)
- Insert operation after posting reply
- Filter logic in comment retrieval

**Complexity Ranking**:
1. **Low**: Database schema and CRUD operations
2. **Medium**: Integration with existing GitHub tools
3. **Low**: Comment filtering logic

**Risk Areas**:
- Thread safety for concurrent comment handling
- Database migration if schema changes
- Comment ID consistency across GitHub API calls

### 4. Technical Decision Analysis

**Data Flow**:
1. `github_get_pr_comments` → Check DB for replied comments → Filter results
2. `github_post_pr_reply` → Post to GitHub → Store comment ID in DB

**Error Handling**:
- Database connection failures (graceful degradation)
- GitHub API errors during reply posting
- Duplicate comment tracking

**Performance**: 
- Index on (pr_id, comment_id) for fast lookups
- Minimal impact on existing workflows

**Configuration**: 
- Database file path (reuse existing config)
- Optional feature toggle

### 5. Development Approach Recommendation

**Implementation Order** (MVP-first):
1. **Phase 1**: Database schema + basic CRUD operations
2. **Phase 2**: Integration with `github_post_pr_reply` for persistence
3. **Phase 3**: Integration with `github_get_pr_comments` for filtering
4. **Phase 4**: Error handling and edge cases

**Testing Strategy**:
- Unit tests for database operations first
- Integration tests with mock GitHub responses
- End-to-end verification with real PR workflow

**MVP Definition**: 
Successfully track one comment reply and filter it from subsequent fetches. Everything else is enhancement.

**Quick Start Approach**:
Start with a simple table schema and basic SQLite operations. Get the data flowing before optimizing. Test with manual database inspection initially, then add proper assertions.

The beauty of this approach is each phase delivers working functionality - you can validate the database layer independently, then the persistence, then the filtering. No complex interdependencies blocking rapid iteration.
