# Developer Analysis

**Feature**: When we use the github_post_pr_reply tool, we need to persist which comments we replied to. And then use this to make sure that subsequent calls of github_get_pr_comments don't return comments that we already replied to.

## Analysis

## 5. Fast Development Sequence

**MVP Implementation Order**:
1. **Extend schema** - Add table to existing `create_schema()` method
2. **Add tracking methods** - 3 simple methods to `SQLiteSymbolStorage`
3. **Hook post_reply** - Single line in `execute_post_pr_reply()`
4. **Filter comments** - Simple list comprehension in `execute_get_pr_comments()`
5. **Test manually** - Quick verification with real PR

**Validation Strategy**:
- **Immediate feedback**: Log every reply tracking operation
- **Simple verification**: Check database with SQL queries
- **End-to-end test**: Reply to comment, verify it disappears from next fetch

**This approach gets a working system in ~30 minutes** by leveraging existing, proven patterns rather than building from scratch.
