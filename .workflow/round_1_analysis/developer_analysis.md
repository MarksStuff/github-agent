# Developer Analysis

**Feature**: When we use the github_post_pr_reply tool, we need to persist which comments we replied to. And then use this to make sure that subsequent calls of github_get_pr_comments don't return comments that we already replied to.

## Analysis

The workspace appears to be empty. Let me work with the general requirements to provide the implementation analysis:

## IMPLEMENTATION ANALYSIS

### 1. Architecture Fit

**Core Problem**: Track PR comment replies to prevent duplicate responses using SQLite persistence.

**Integration Strategy**:
- Extend existing GitHub tools workflow with a persistence layer
- Create a comment tracking service that sits between GitHub API calls and response logic
- Follow typical service pattern where database operations are abstracted behind a clean interface

### 2. Database Design Approach

**SQLite Schema Strategy**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE pr_comment_replies (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    pr_number INTEGER NOT NULL,
    comment_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    reply_id TEXT,
    repo_owner TEXT NOT NULL,
    repo_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    replied_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE(comment_id, pr_number, repo_owner, repo_name)
);
```

**Key Design Decisions**:
- Use composite unique constraint to prevent duplicate tracking
- Include repo context for multi-repo scenarios
- Store both original comment ID and our reply ID for audit trail

### 3. Implementation Strategy

**Service Layer Approach**:
- Create `PRCommentTracker` class with methods:
  - `markCommentReplied(commentId, prNumber, repoInfo, replyId)`
  - `isCommentReplied(commentId, prNumber, repoInfo)`
  - `filterUnrepliedComments(comments, prNumber, repoInfo)`

**Integration Points**:
- Modify `github_get_pr_comments` to filter out already-replied comments
- Hook into `github_post_pr_reply` to automatically mark comments as replied

### 4. Development Approach Recommendation

**Phase 1 - MVP** (Get it working fast):
1. Create basic SQLite connection utility
2. Implement simple comment tracking table
3. Add basic mark/check functionality
4. Test with one PR manually

**Phase 2 - Integration**:
1. Hook into existing GitHub tools
2. Add filtering logic to get_comments
3. Add auto-tracking to post_reply

**Phase 3 - Polish**:
1. Add error handling and cleanup
2. Performance optimization
3. Migration support

### 5. Quick Implementation Wins

**Leverage Existing Patterns**:
- If codebase has database utilities, extend them
- Mirror existing GitHub tool patterns for consistency
- Use same error handling patterns as other tools

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Start with in-memory proof-of-concept
- Add database persistence once logic is proven
- Use database transactions for reliability

**Testing Strategy**:
- Test with mock GitHub API responses first
- Verify database operations independently
- Integration test with actual PR scenarios last

This approach prioritizes getting a working solution quickly while building on solid foundations that can be extended later.
