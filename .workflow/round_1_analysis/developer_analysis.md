# Developer Analysis

**Feature**: When we use the github_post_pr_reply tool, we need to persist which comments we replied to. And then use this to make sure that subsequent calls of github_get_pr_comments don't return comments that we already replied to.

## Analysis

## Fast Implementation Analysis

### 1. Implementation Approach (Quick Wins)

**Core Strategy:** Simple SQLite table + wrapper functions
- Create `replied_comments` table with comment_id + timestamp
- Modify existing tools to check/record replies
- Use basic SQL operations - fast to implement

**Quick wins first:**
1. Single table design: `(comment_id, pr_number, replied_at)`
2. Two helper functions: `mark_comment_replied()` and `is_comment_replied()`
3. Filter logic in `github_get_pr_comments`

### 2. Development Estimate

**MVP: 2-3 hours**
- Database setup: 30 mins
- Helper functions: 45 mins  
- Integration: 60 mins
- Basic testing: 30 mins

**Milestones:**
1. Working SQLite table (30 mins)
2. Reply tracking works (1 hour)
3. Comment filtering works (1.5 hours)
4. End-to-end validation (2 hours)

### 3. Technical Choices (Speed-focused)

**Libraries:** Use Python's built-in `sqlite3` - zero dependencies
**Schema:** Minimal viable structure:
```sql
CREATE TABLE replied_comments (
    comment_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    pr_number INTEGER,
    replied_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

**Integration points:**
- `github_post_pr_reply`: Add `mark_comment_replied(comment_id)` call
- `github_get_pr_comments`: Filter with `WHERE comment_id NOT IN (SELECT...)`

### 4. Prototype Ideas

**Quick validation:**
1. Create table + insert test data
2. Verify filtering works with mock comments
3. Test reply marking functionality

**Prototype demonstrates:** Comments disappear from results after reply, no duplicates possible.

**Next steps:** Add error handling, consider bulk operations, add cleanup for old entries.
