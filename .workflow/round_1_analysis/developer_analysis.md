# Developer Analysis

**Feature**: When we use the github_post_pr_reply tool, we need to persist which comments we replied to. And then use this to make sure that subsequent calls of github_get_pr_comments don't return comments that we already replied to.

## Analysis

The workspace is empty. Let me analyze the implementation approach based on the GitHub tools and symbol storage code I found in the absolute paths.

## Implementation Strategy Analysis

Based on the existing codebase patterns from `/Users/mstriebeck/Code/github-agent/`, here's my analysis for implementing PR comment reply persistence:

### 1. **Architecture Fit**

**Perfect Integration Points:**
- **Symbol Storage Pattern**: The existing `SQLiteSymbolStorage` class provides an excellent architectural template. The comment tracking should follow the same patterns with `AbstractCommentTracker` → `SQLiteCommentTracker` → `ProductionCommentTracker`
- **GitHub Tools Integration**: Add the persistence directly into `execute_post_pr_reply()` in `github_tools.py` to track successful replies automatically
- **Repository Context**: Leverage the existing `GitHubAPIContext` class for repository-scoped comment tracking

**File Organization:**
- Create `comment_tracker.py` alongside `symbol_storage.py` 
- Add tracking logic directly in `github_tools.py` → `execute_post_pr_reply()`
- Modify `execute_get_pr_comments()` to filter out already-replied comments

### 2. **Existing Code Leverage Analysis**

**High Reuse Potential:**
- **Database Infrastructure**: Copy the entire SQLite pattern from `symbol_storage.py` - the connection management, retry logic, schema creation, and error handling are production-ready
- **Repository Manager Integration**: Use existing `repo_manager` and `GitHubAPIContext` for repository-scoped operations
- **GitHub API Patterns**: Follow existing request/response patterns in `execute_get_pr_comments()` and `execute_post_pr_reply()`

**Specific Components to Reuse:**
- `_execute_with_retry()` pattern for database resilience
- `DATA_DIR` constant and directory structure
- Connection pooling and WAL mode configuration from `SQLiteSymbolStorage`
- Error handling patterns from existing GitHub API calls

### 3. **Implementation Complexity Assessment**

**Minimal Viable Implementation (LOW COMPLEXITY):**
```
1. CommentReply table: (comment_id, repository_id, replied_at)
2. Track replies in execute_post_pr_reply() 
3. Filter in execute_get_pr_comments()
```

**STRAIGHTFORWARD Components:**
- Database schema creation (reuse SQLite patterns)
- Basic CRUD operations (copy from symbol_storage.py)
- Integration with existing GitHub API calls

**MEDIUM COMPLEXITY:**
- Deciding on comment deduplication strategy (by ID vs by content hash)
- Handling edge cases (deleted comments, edited comments)

**RISK AREAS:**
- GitHub API rate limiting when checking comment status
- Handling repository name mapping between config and GitHub API
- Thread safety if multiple processes reply to comments

### 4. **Technical Decision Analysis**

**Data Flow:**
```
github_post_pr_reply() → successful reply → CommentTracker.mark_replied()
github_get_pr_comments() → CommentTracker.filter_unreplied() → return filtered list
```

**Schema Design (Minimal):**
```sql
CREATE TABLE replied_comments (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    comment_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    repository_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    pr_number INTEGER NOT NULL,
    replied_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE(comment_id, repository_id)
)
```

**Error Handling Strategy:**
- Track replies AFTER successful GitHub API response
- If tracking fails, log warning but don't fail the reply operation
- Provide manual cleanup tools for corrupted tracking data

### 5. **Development Approach Recommendation**

**Implementation Order (Risk-Minimized):**

1. **Phase 1**: Create `comment_tracker.py` with basic schema and operations (copy `symbol_storage.py` patterns)
2. **Phase 2**: Add tracking call to `execute_post_pr_reply()` after successful API response
3. **Phase 3**: Add filtering logic to `execute_get_pr_comments()` with feature flag
4. **Phase 4**: Add cleanup/management tools

**Validation Strategy:**
- Unit tests for database operations (follow `symbol_storage.py` test patterns)
- Integration test: reply to comment → verify tracking → get comments → verify filtering
- Manual testing with actual GitHub PR

**MVP Definition:**
- Can track when we reply to a comment
- Can filter out already-replied comments from `github_get_pr_comments`
- Graceful degradation if tracking fails (show all comments)

**Key Implementation Notes:**
- Use same database file (`symbols.db`) to avoid multiple database management
- Repository-scope the tracking (same comment ID can exist across different repos)
- Keep it simple - track successful replies only, don't try to validate comment existence
- Add `--reset-comment-tracking` flag for debugging/cleanup

This approach leverages the robust existing infrastructure while keeping the implementation focused and low-risk.
