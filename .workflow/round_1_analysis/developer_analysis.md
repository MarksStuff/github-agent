# Developer Analysis

**Feature**: When we use the github_post_pr_reply tool, we need to persist which comments we replied to. And then use this to make sure that subsequent calls of github_get_pr_comments don't return comments that we already replied to.

## Analysis

Based on the analysis document and the context provided, let me provide the implementation analysis based on the described architecture:

## IMPLEMENTATION ANALYSIS: GitHub Comment Reply Tracking

### 1. **Implementation Strategy Analysis**

**Architecture Fit**: This feature aligns perfectly with the existing SQLite symbol storage pattern. The `symbol_storage.py` module provides a proven template for database abstractions with the `AbstractSymbolStorage` interface and `SQLiteSymbolStorage` implementation.

**File Organization**: Following the established pattern:
- Create `comment_reply_storage.py` in the root directory alongside `symbol_storage.py`
- Extend `github_tools.py` to integrate the tracking functionality
- Keep database schema updates within the storage module

**Class Design**: Mirror the symbol storage pattern:
- `AbstractCommentReplyStorage` interface
- `SQLiteCommentReplyStorage` implementation 
- `ProductionCommentReplyStorage` factory
- Integration into `GitHubAPIContext` for repository-specific access

**Integration Points**: Hook into existing workflow at two key points:
- `github_post_pr_reply` - Add tracking after successful reply
- `github_get_pr_comments` - Filter out already-replied comments

### 2. **Existing Code Leverage Analysis**

**Reusable Components**: 
- SQLite connection patterns from `symbol_storage.py`
- Error handling and retry logic already proven
- Database initialization in `mcp_master.py` pattern
- WAL mode and connection pooling strategies

**Utility Functions**: 
- Existing database location logic (`~/.local/share/github-agent/symbols.db`)
- Batch processing patterns (though less relevant here)
- Timestamp handling from symbol storage

**Patterns to Follow**:
- Same abstract base class pattern
- Identical error resilience approach
- Repository-scoped operations via `repository_id`
- Dependency injection through constructor

**Dependencies**: All required SQLite infrastructure already exists - no new dependencies needed.

### 3. **Implementation Complexity Assessment**

**Core vs. Optional**:
- **Core**: Basic reply tracking with comment ID + repository scope
- **Optional**: Reply content storage, user tracking, timestamp queries

**Complexity Ranking**:
- **Low**: Database schema and basic CRUD operations
- **Medium**: Integration into existing GitHub tools without breaking changes
- **Low**: Filtering logic in comment retrieval

**Risk Areas**:
- Comment ID uniqueness across different PR contexts
- Ensuring atomic operations between reply posting and tracking
- Thread safety with concurrent workers (though existing symbol storage handles this)

**Validation Strategy**: 
- Test with single PR comment cycle
- Verify filtering works across multiple calls
- Confirm no duplicate replies on repeated runs

### 4. **Technical Decision Analysis**

**Data Flow**:
1. `github_get_pr_comments` → Query tracking storage → Filter results
2. `github_post_pr_reply` → Post to GitHub → Record in tracking storage

**Error Handling**:
- If tracking storage fails after successful reply, log warning but don't fail
- If tracking lookup fails, default to returning all comments (safe fallback)
- Repository ID validation to prevent cross-contamination

**Performance**: Minimal impact - simple indexed lookups, same database as symbols

**Configuration**: Reuse existing database location pattern, no new config needed

### 5. **Development Approach Recommendation**

**Implementation Order**:
1. **Database schema & storage class** - Standalone, testable component
2. **Integration into github_post_pr_reply** - Low-risk addition
3. **Filtering in github_get_pr_comments** - Core feature completion
4. **Error handling refinement** - Polish and edge cases

**Testing Strategy**:
- Unit tests for storage operations
- Integration test with mock GitHub API calls
- End-to-end test with actual PR comment cycle

**MVP Definition**: 
- Successfully track one comment reply
- Filter that comment from subsequent retrievals
- No crashes or data corruption under normal operation

**Quick Start Approach**:
Database schema first - simple table with comment_id, repository_id, replied_at. Then integrate tracking into post operation, finally add filtering to get operation. This minimizes risk while enabling rapid feedback on each component.

The existing SQLite infrastructure makes this a straightforward extension rather than a complex new feature. The proven patterns reduce implementation risk significantly.
