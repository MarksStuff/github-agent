# Developer Analysis

**Feature**: When we use the github_post_pr_reply tool, we need to persist which comments we replied to. And then use this to make sure that subsequent calls of github_get_pr_comments don't return comments that we already replied to.

## Analysis

## Key Implementation Insights

**Why This Is Perfect for Fast Development**:

1. **Zero New Dependencies** - Pure extension of existing SQLite patterns
2. **Minimal Integration Surface** - Just two function modifications
3. **Proven Architecture** - Copy-paste from working symbol storage
4. **Immediate Validation** - Can test with real GitHub API calls right away
5. **Low Risk** - Separate database, no impact on existing functionality

**Fastest Path to Working Code**:
- Start with `symbol_storage.py` as exact template
- Change table schema from symbols to replied_comments  
- Add single line to `execute_post_pr_reply()` after successful API call
- Add filtering logic to `execute_get_pr_comments()` before returning results
- Use existing `DATA_DIR` and production patterns

The existing codebase has excellent separation of concerns and robust patterns that make this feature a straightforward extension rather than a complex new implementation.
