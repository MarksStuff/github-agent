# Tester Analysis

**Feature**: When we use the github_post_pr_reply tool, we need to persist which comments we replied to. And then use this to make sure that subsequent calls of github_get_pr_comments don't return comments that we already replied to.

## Analysis

### TDD IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

**Start with failing tests first:**
1. Write `test_mark_comment_as_replied_stores_comment_id()` - FAIL
2. Implement minimal `CommentTracker.mark_comment_as_replied()` - PASS
3. Write `test_filter_new_comments_removes_replied_comments()` - FAIL  
4. Extend implementation - PASS
5. Continue TDD cycle

**Testing hierarchy focus:**
- **Unit tests**: 15 specific test methods covering all classes
- **Integration tests**: 3 comprehensive workflow tests
- **Mocking strategy**: Custom mock classes for GitHubAPI and Database
- **Dependency injection**: Constructor injection for all dependencies

This specification ensures comprehensive test coverage while following TDD principles and making the code highly testable through dependency injection.
