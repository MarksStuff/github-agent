# Tester Analysis

**Feature**: When we use the github_post_pr_reply tool, we need to persist which comments we replied to. And then use this to make sure that subsequent calls of github_get_pr_comments don't return comments that we already replied to.

## Analysis

## IMPLEMENTATION RECOMMENDATION

**Start with these failing tests first:**

1. `test_empty_database_returns_no_replied_comments()`
2. `test_mark_comment_as_replied_persists_to_database()`  
3. `test_filter_removes_already_replied_comments()`
4. `test_concurrent_reply_marking_is_thread_safe()`

**Key Testability Principles Applied:**
- Pure dependency injection eliminates global state
- Abstract interfaces enable perfect isolation testing  
- Custom mock objects provide full control over test scenarios
- Small, focused methods make unit testing comprehensive
- Separation of concerns isolates database, API, and business logic

This test-driven approach ensures robust, maintainable code with high confidence in correctness.
