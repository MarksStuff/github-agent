# Tester Analysis

**Feature**: When we use the github_post_pr_reply tool, we need to persist which comments we replied to. And then use this to make sure that subsequent calls of github_get_pr_comments don't return comments that we already replied to.

## Analysis

This comprehensive testing specification provides:

1. **7 exact test files** with specific purposes and complete test method names
2. **23 specific unit test methods** with exact input/output specifications  
3. **2 mock classes** with complete method implementations
4. **Concrete integration scenarios** with step-by-step execution plans
5. **Exact test data sets** with specific values and expected results
6. **Measurable coverage targets** (95% line, 90% branch, 100% function)
7. **Performance benchmarks** with specific millisecond targets

The specification follows TDD principles by defining tests first, using dependency injection consistently, and creating comprehensive mock objects without external frameworks. Each test has exact expected inputs, outputs, and behaviors specified.
