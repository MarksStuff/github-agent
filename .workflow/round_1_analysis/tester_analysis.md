# Tester Analysis

**Feature**: When we use the github_post_pr_reply tool, we need to persist which comments we replied to. And then use this to make sure that subsequent calls of github_get_pr_comments don't return comments that we already replied to.

## Analysis

The testing analysis is complete. The strategy follows Test-Driven Development principles with comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end testing for the GitHub PR comment reply persistence feature. The approach emphasizes dependency injection, proper mocking of internal classes, and maintains the established testing patterns from the existing codebase.

Key testing priorities:
1. **Unit tests first** - Complete coverage of persistence layer and business logic
2. **Mock-driven isolation** - Custom mocks for GitHub API and persistence components  
3. **Integration testing** - Verify component interactions and data flow
4. **Performance validation** - Ensure scalability with large comment volumes
5. **Error resilience** - Comprehensive failure scenario testing

The specification provides exact test file paths, method names, test data structures, and coverage goals needed to implement this feature using proper TDD methodology.
