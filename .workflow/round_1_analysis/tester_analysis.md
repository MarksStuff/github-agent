# Tester Analysis

**Feature**: When we use the github_post_pr_reply tool, we need to persist which comments we replied to. And then use this to make sure that subsequent calls of github_get_pr_comments don't return comments that we already replied to.

## Analysis

## TDD IMPLEMENTATION SEQUENCE:

1. **Write failing tests first** for `CommentReplyStore.store_comment_reply()`
2. **Implement minimal SQLite schema** to make tests pass
3. **Write failing tests** for comment filtering logic
4. **Implement filtering** to exclude already-replied comments
5. **Write integration tests** for complete workflow
6. **Refactor for dependency injection** to enable comprehensive mocking

This test-driven approach ensures every piece of functionality is verified before implementation, with comprehensive coverage of the comment reply persistence feature using SQLite as specified.
