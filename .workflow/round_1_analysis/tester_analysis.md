# Tester Analysis

**Feature**: When we use the github_post_pr_reply tool, we need to persist which comments we replied to. And then use this to make sure that subsequent calls of github_get_pr_comments don't return comments that we already replied to.

## Analysis

## IMPLEMENTATION SEQUENCE

**Test-Driven Implementation Order:**
1. **Write failing unit tests** for `CommentRepository` interface
2. **Implement SQLite repository** to pass tests  
3. **Write failing tests** for comment filtering logic
4. **Implement filtering** with dependency injection
5. **Write integration tests** for GitHub + database interaction
6. **Write end-to-end tests** for complete workflow
7. **Refactor** for better testability and performance

This test-first approach ensures reliability, catches edge cases early, and creates maintainable code with comprehensive safety nets.
