# Architect Analysis

**Feature**: When we use the github_post_pr_reply tool, we need to persist which comments we replied to. And then use this to make sure that subsequent calls of github_get_pr_comments don't return comments that we already replied to.

## Analysis

## Architectural Recommendations

**Design Pattern**: Repository Pattern with Unit of Work for database operations
**Integration Strategy**: Extend existing SQLite infrastructure rather than introducing new persistence layer
**Scalability Approach**: Start simple with SQLite - upgrade only if actual performance data justifies complexity

**Key Architectural Principles Applied:**
1. **Single Responsibility**: CommentFilter handles filtering logic separately from API calls
2. **Consistency**: Follow existing database patterns and transaction handling
3. **Realistic Scale**: SQLite appropriate for GitHub agent workload patterns
4. **Fail-Safe Design**: Graceful degradation if tracking fails doesn't break core functionality

This architecture maintains system cohesion while adding the required functionality with minimal complexity overhead.
