# Architect Analysis

**Feature**: When we use the github_post_pr_reply tool, we need to persist which comments we replied to. And then use this to make sure that subsequent calls of github_get_pr_comments don't return comments that we already replied to.

## Analysis

## Summary

The architecture leverages SQLite's ACID properties for reliable comment tracking while maintaining loose coupling through dependency injection. The system extends existing GitHub tools with optional tracking functionality, ensuring backward compatibility. The database schema optimizes for common queries (filtering by PR) while the application layer provides clean abstractions for comment management.

Key architectural decisions:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Storage, tracking logic, and GitHub API operations are distinct layers
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing tools work unchanged; tracking is optional
- **Performance**: Indexed queries and efficient filtering for large PR comment sets
- **Maintainability**: Clear interfaces and established patterns from existing symbol storage
