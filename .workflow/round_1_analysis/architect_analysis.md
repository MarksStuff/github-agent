# Architect Analysis

**Feature**: When we use the github_post_pr_reply tool, we need to persist which comments we replied to. And then use this to make sure that subsequent calls of github_get_pr_comments don't return comments that we already replied to.

## Analysis

## ARCHITECTURAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### Design Pattern Consistency
This implementation maintains **architectural integrity** by:
- **Reusing existing SQLite storage patterns** from [`symbol_storage.py`](file:///Users/mstriebeck/Code/github-agent/symbol_storage.py)
- **Following dependency injection** patterns from [`CodebaseTools`](file:///Users/mstriebeck/Code/github-agent/codebase_tools.py#L69)
- **Extending abstract base classes** rather than creating new ones
- **Using established error handling** with retry mechanisms

### Scalability Approach
The solution scales appropriately by:
- **Repository-scoped storage** - Each repository's data isolated by `repository_id`
- **Efficient indexing** - Composite indexes on commonly queried fields
- **Minimal API overhead** - Single database query to filter replied comments
- **No breaking changes** - Backward compatible with existing installations

### Technology Choice Rationale
**SQLite extension** is optimal because:
- **Existing infrastructure** - Leverages current database and patterns
- **Team expertise** - No new database technology to learn
- **Operational simplicity** - Single database file, established backup patterns
- **Performance** - Indexed queries for comment filtering scale to thousands of comments

This approach ensures **long-term maintainability** while solving the immediate requirement with **minimal complexity** and **maximum consistency** with existing architectural patterns.
