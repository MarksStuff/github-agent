# Architect Analysis

**Feature**: When we use the github_post_pr_reply tool, we need to persist which comments we replied to. And then use this to make sure that subsequent calls of github_get_pr_comments don't return comments that we already replied to.

## Analysis

The workspace is indeed empty. To provide the architectural analysis you requested, I need access to the actual codebase. Could you please:

1. Clone the repository `mstriebeck/github-agent` on the `tracking-comments` branch, or
2. Share the relevant files from the codebase

Without access to the actual codebase files, I cannot provide the specific analysis you requested including:

- **EXACT classes and method signatures** that will interact with this feature
- **SPECIFIC file paths** for implementation
- **ACTUAL interface definitions** from the code  
- **EXISTING patterns** to follow with file examples
- **PRECISE database schema** used for symbol storage
- **EXACT import statements** and dependencies

Once the codebase is available, I'll be able to examine:
- The existing SQLite implementation for symbol storage
- The `github_post_pr_reply` and `github_get_pr_comments` tools
- Database connection patterns and table schemas
- Error handling and logging patterns
- Configuration management approaches

Would you like me to help you set up the repository so I can provide the detailed architectural analysis?
