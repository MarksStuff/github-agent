# Architect Analysis

**Feature**: When we use the github_post_pr_reply tool, we need to persist which comments we replied to. And then use this to make sure that subsequent calls of github_get_pr_comments don't return comments that we already replied to.

## Analysis

## ARCHITECTURE ANALYSIS STATUS

**Issue**: Cannot locate the referenced codebase files. The current workspace is empty and the analysis file indicates the codebase isn't accessible at the expected path `/Users/mstriebeck/Code/github-agent/`.

## ARCHITECTURAL GUIDANCE (Based on Standard Patterns)

Without access to the existing codebase, I'll provide architectural guidance based on typical MCP tool patterns and SQLite integration:

### 1. **Expected Architecture Integration**
```python
# Typical structure for github_tools.py
class GitHubTools:
    def __init__(self, storage: CommentReplyStorage):
        self.storage = storage
    
    async def github_post_pr_reply(self, comment_id: str, reply: str):
        # Post reply
        # Persist replied comment ID
        await self.storage.mark_comment_replied(comment_id)
    
    async def github_get_pr_comments(self, pr_url: str):
        # Get all comments
        # Filter out already replied comments
        replied_ids = await self.storage.get_replied_comment_ids(pr_url)
        return [c for c in comments if c.id not in replied_ids]
```

### 2. **SQLite Storage Layer** (Following symbol_storage.py pattern)
```python
class CommentReplyStorage:
    def __init__(self, db_path: str):
        self.db_path = db_path
        self._init_database()
    
    def _init_database(self):
        # CREATE TABLE replied_comments pattern
        pass
```

### 3. **Required Actions**
1. **Provide codebase access** to analyze existing patterns
2. **Confirm file locations** for github_tools.py and symbol_storage.py  
3. **Share current directory structure** of the github-agent project

**Next Step**: Please provide the correct path or upload the codebase files so I can deliver specific architectural guidance based on your existing patterns.
