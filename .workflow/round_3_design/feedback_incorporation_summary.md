# Feedback Incorporation Summary

**Date**: 2025-08-01T08:57:37.386469
**PR**: #65

## Overview

This document summarizes how GitHub PR feedback was incorporated into the finalized design.

## Feedback Addressed

I need to see both the original and updated design documents to compare them and create the summary of changes you requested.

Could you please provide:
1. The original design document (26,447 chars)
2. The updated design document (22,459 chars)

Once I have both documents, I can analyze the specific changes made to address each piece of feedback and create the detailed summary you're looking for.

## Documents

- Original design: `.workflow/round_2_design/consolidated_design.md`
- Updated design: `.workflow/round_3_design/finalized_design.md`
