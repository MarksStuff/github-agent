# Feedback Incorporation Summary

**Date**: 2025-08-01T11:33:02.833947
**PR**: #65

## Overview

This document summarizes how GitHub PR feedback was incorporated into the finalized design.

## Feedback Addressed

I need to see both the original and updated design documents to analyze the changes made in response to the feedback. Could you please provide both documents so I can create the comprehensive comparison summary you're requesting?

Once you provide the documents, I'll analyze:
1. Each feedback item and the specific changes made to address it
2. Which sections were updated and how
3. A concise summary focused on the architectural changes that maintain system integrity

## Documents

- Original design: `.workflow/round_2_design/consolidated_design.md`
- Updated design: `.workflow/round_3_design/finalized_design.md`
