This implementation design provides a complete blueprint for building the GitHub comment reply tracking system. The design resolves the key conflicts from the peer reviews by implementing a staged approach: starting with a simple file-based MVP that can be deployed immediately, then evolving to a more robust SQLite-based solution for production use.

The key architectural decisions include:
- Repository pattern with abstract base class for storage flexibility
- Clear separation between tracking replied-to comments and our own created comments
- File-based storage for MVP (1-2 days) transitioning to SQLite for production
- Comprehensive test strategy covering unit, integration, and performance scenarios
- Zero-disruption integration with existing GitHub tools

The design is immediately implementable with specific class definitions, method signatures, database schemas, and integration points clearly specified.
