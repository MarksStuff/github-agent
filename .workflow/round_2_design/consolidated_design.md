# Consolidated Design Document (Fallback)

## Overview
This document consolidates the analyses from all four agents, incorporating peer review feedback and conflict resolution.

## Agent Contributions Summary

### Architect
**Key Points**: **Modules to Modify:**; - `simple_lsp_client.py:28-422` - Add new `get_document_symbols()` method following existing pattern; - `codebase_tools.py:61-67` - Register new `get_document_symbols` tool in TOOL_HANDLERS mapping

### Developer
**Key Points**: **Architecture Fit:**; - The feature aligns perfectly with existing patterns - we already have `Symbol` dataclass and AST-based extraction; - Current flow: File → AST → Flat symbols → Storage

### Senior Engineer
**Key Points**: **EXACT existing classes demonstrating good patterns:**; - `AbstractSymbolStorage` (symbol_storage.py:88-202): Clean abstract interface with comprehensive method definitions; - `SQLiteSymbolStorage` (symbol_storage.py:204-718): Exemplary resilient implementation with `_execute_with_retry` pattern

### Tester
**Key Points**: Now, based on my analysis of the codebase testing patterns, here's the comprehensive testing specification for the Document Symbol Hierarchy feature:; **Testing Approach**: Following existing abstract base + mock implementation pattern; - Abstract base class for symbol hierarchy provider

## Design Summary

Based on the multi-agent analysis and conflict resolution, the design focuses on:

### Technical Approach
Repository Pattern with SQLite persistence, following existing infrastructure patterns and dependency injection for testability.

### Implementation Strategy
1. Start with test-driven development for core repository interface
2. Implement SQLite repository following existing database patterns
3. Integrate with existing GitHub tool infrastructure
4. Add comment filtering logic to existing API tools

### Quality Assurance
- Comprehensive unit testing with dependency injection
- Integration tests for GitHub API interactions
- Test-driven development for core business logic
- Code review focusing on maintainability and clean architecture

### Next Steps
1. Review this consolidated design document
2. Provide feedback on any remaining concerns
3. Proceed to implementation planning with resolved approach
