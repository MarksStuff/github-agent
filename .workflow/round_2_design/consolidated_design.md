The consolidated design document provides implementation-ready specifications that resolve the identified conflicts while maintaining architectural integrity. Key decisions include:

**Architectural Consistency**: Direct adaptation of `SQLiteSymbolStorage` patterns rather than creating new abstractions, ensuring consistency with existing codebase patterns.

**Testing Integration**: Comprehensive test specifications with mock implementations, unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end scenarios following established testing patterns.

**Conflict Resolution**: Balanced approach that prioritizes architectural consistency while addressing testing concerns through enhanced test coverage and validation strategies.

The design includes complete class definitions, database schemas, integration specifications, and deployment procedures, leaving no ambiguity about implementation requirements.
