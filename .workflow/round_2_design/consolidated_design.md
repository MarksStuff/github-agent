### Conflict Resolution Summary

1. **Complexity vs Speed**: Resolved through iterative approach - start simple, evolve based on actual requirements
2. **Storage Technology**: JSON first for immediate implementation, SQLite migration path when performance data justifies
3. **Testing Strategy**: Core tests Day 1, comprehensive suite by Day 3, manual validation in Hour 2
4. **Architecture Patterns**: Single responsibility classes without over-abstraction, clear separation between tracking and filtering concerns

This design provides immediate value while maintaining clear evolution paths for future enhancements based on real usage patterns and performance requirements.
