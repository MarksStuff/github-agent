## ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS SUMMARY

### Design Pattern Choices

**Repository Pattern**: Enables clean separation between business logic and storage implementation, supporting both file-based and database storage with identical interfaces.

**Factory Pattern**: Provides centralized tracker creation with configuration-driven implementation selection, reducing coupling and improving testability.

**Dependency Injection**: Global tracker instance management allows for easy testing and configuration changes without modifying core business logic.

### Scalability Considerations  

**File vs Database Storage**: File-based implementation for rapid prototyping and small-scale deployment; SQLite for production with better concurrent access and query performance.

**Caching Strategy**: In-memory caching in file tracker reduces I/O overhead; database implementation relies on SQLite's built-in caching.

**Index Design**: Strategic database indexes on comment_id, processed_at, and response_type support efficient filtering and history queries.

### Integration Strategy

**Minimal Invasive Changes**: Existing GitHub tool functions maintain backward compatibility while adding optional tracking functionality through new parameters.

**Graceful Degradation**: System continues operating even if tracking fails, ensuring core comment processing remains reliable.

**Configuration Flexibility**: Environment variables and configuration files support different deployment scenarios without code changes.

This design provides a robust, scalable comment tracking system that prevents duplicate processing while maintaining architectural integrity and supporting realistic production requirements.
