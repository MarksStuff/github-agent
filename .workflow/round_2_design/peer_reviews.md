## Architect Peer Review

**Status**: success

The architectural review is complete. Based on my analysis of the actual codebase at `/Users/mstriebeck/Code/github-agent`, all three peer proposals have significant architectural conflicts with existing patterns:

**Key Findings:**

1. **Retry Pattern**: Existing `SQLiteSymbolStorage` uses internal `_execute_with_retry()` method (line 201), not external composition as all peers proposed.

2. **Date Handling**: Codebase consistently uses ISO string storage with `datetime.fromisoformat()` parsing (health_monitor.py:456), not complex serialization layers.

3. **Testing**: Mock pattern extends abstract base classes directly (mock_symbol_storage.py:6) with no external dependencies, violating tester's dependency injection approach.

4. **Integration**: All peers missed required modifications to existing `github_get_pr_comments()` (line 392) and `TOOL_HANDLERS` mapping (line 880).

5. **Naming**: Multiple convention violations (missing `Abstract` prefixes, wrong class names).

The feature should follow existing architectural patterns rather than introducing new paradigms that conflict with the established codebase design.

## Developer Peer Review

**Status**: success

## **Bottom Line: Ship Simple, Iterate Later**

**What's Wrong with Peer Analyses:**
- Too much abstraction before proof of concept
- Complex testing strategies before basic functionality 
- Interface hierarchies for a simple tracking feature

**What Gets Us Working Today:**
1. **60 lines of code** vs. complex class hierarchies
2. **Simple retry decorator** vs. RetryStrategy interfaces  
3. **JSON file storage** vs. sophisticated persistence layers
4. **One integration test** to verify end-to-end workflow

**MVP Delivery Plan:**
1. Code the `CommentTracker` class (15 minutes)
2. Integrate with existing GitHub tools (10 minutes)  
3. Test with real PR comments (5 minutes)
4. **Ship it and get feedback**

The peer analyses are solving tomorrow's scalability problems today. Let's solve today's user problem first, then iterate based on real usage patterns.

## Senior Engineer Peer Review

**Status**: success

## Tester Peer Review

**Status**: success

## **VERDICT: All Analyses Fail Testing Standards**

**Primary Recommendation**: **Start with pytest framework setup before any implementation**. The Senior Engineer analysis has the best architectural foundation, but requires comprehensive test strategy overlay.

**Critical Missing Elements:**
- Test-driven development methodology
- Dependency injection for mock objects  
- Error scenario comprehensive coverage
- GitHub API testing strategy
- Race condition testing

**None of the analyses are ready for implementation without establishing proper testing infrastructure first.**
