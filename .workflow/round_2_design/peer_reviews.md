## Architect Peer Review

**Status**: success

**Summary**: All peer proposals violate existing architectural patterns. The retry mechanism already exists in [`SQLiteSymbolStorage`](file:///Users/mstriebeck/Code/github-agent/symbol_storage.py#L127), and any new storage implementation must follow the exact same constructor and retry pattern rather than introducing new composition patterns that conflict with the established codebase architecture.

## Developer Peer Review

**Status**: success

**Chunk 1 (30 min):** Basic tracking
- Simple dict/set to track `{pr_id: [replied_comment_ids]}`
- Persist to JSON file
- Modify `github_post_pr_reply` to record replies

**Chunk 2 (15 min):** Filter comments
- Modify `github_get_pr_comments` to exclude replied comments
- Test with real PR data

**Chunk 3 (Later):** Polish
- Add retry mechanism if needed
- Upgrade to proper date handling
- Consider SQLite if file storage becomes a bottleneck

### Key Disagreements

**Architect's approach** is architecturally sound but over-engineered for rapid development. We don't need "repository scoping" or "composite indexes" until we prove the feature works.

**Tester's dependency injection** focus is premature optimization. Get it working first, then make it testable.

**Senior Engineer's composition** is the sweet spot - good design without complexity overhead.

**Next Action:** Build the 30-minute MVP with JSON storage, then iterate based on real usage feedback.

## Tester Peer Review

**Status**: success

**Critical Quality Risks**:
1. **Data consistency bugs** - No transactional testing strategy mentioned
2. **Silent failures** - Missing comprehensive error scenario testing  
3. **Performance degradation** - No load testing for database queries with large comment histories
4. **Concurrency issues** - Multiple agent instances could corrupt comment tracking state

**Required Test-First Implementation Order**:
1. Write failing unit tests for comment persistence and retrieval
2. Create mock GitHub API respecting rate limits and failures
3. Implement retry mechanism with configurable failure injection for testing
4. Build integration tests covering complete PR comment workflow
5. Add end-to-end tests with real SQLite database but controlled GitHub API responses

**Recommendation**: Before implementing any of these approaches, establish a comprehensive test suite architecture with dependency injection and proper mocking strategies to ensure the comment tracking feature is bulletproof from day one.
