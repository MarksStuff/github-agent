## Architect Peer Review

**Status**: success

## Summary

**CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL ISSUES**:
- Developer analysis violates existing factory and dependency injection patterns
- Senior engineer's `RetryManager` composition breaks [`SQLiteSymbolStorage`](file:///Users/mstriebeck/Code/github-agent/symbol_storage.py) encapsulation
- Missing integration with [`CodebaseTools`](file:///Users/mstriebeck/Code/github-agent/codebase_tools.py) constructor injection

**REQUIRED APPROACH**: Direct copy-paste adaptation of [`symbol_storage.py`](file:///Users/mstriebeck/Code/github-agent/symbol_storage.py) patterns with comment-specific data schema. This maintains architectural consistency with the existing master-worker, dependency injection, and abstract base class patterns.

## Senior Engineer Peer Review

**Status**: success



---

## Tester Peer Review

**Status**: success

**VERDICT**: All three analyses lack sufficient testing focus for production deployment. Recommend rejecting current approaches and restarting with comprehensive test-driven development methodology as the primary design constraint.
