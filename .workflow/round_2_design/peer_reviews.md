## Architect Peer Review

**Status**: success

### **Critical Architectural Principle Violations**

The proposals violate core architectural principles:

1. **Dependency Inversion**: Must depend on existing `AbstractSymbolStorage` pattern, not create new abstractions
2. **Single Responsibility**: Retry logic belongs in storage implementations, not separate classes  
3. **Open/Closed**: Extend existing patterns rather than creating competing patterns
4. **Interface Segregation**: Use existing repository context system, don't bypass it

**Bottom Line**: The proposals need fundamental rework to align with the established master-worker architecture, repository-aware tools pattern, and existing storage abstractions. Focus on extending proven patterns rather than introducing new ones.

## Developer Peer Review

**Status**: success

**Fastest Path:**
1. Build basic `CommentStorage` with in-memory Set (my implementation)
2. Add simple retry wrapper around GitHub API calls
3. Test with real PR data
4. Then worry about persistence, configuration, and fancy abstractions

**Iterative Opportunities:**
- **MVP**: In-memory comment tracking (working in 30 mins)
- **v2**: File-based persistence (add later when needed)
- **v3**: Retry configuration (only if failures happen)

**Where I Disagree:**
The **Senior Engineer** and **Tester** are solving tomorrow's problems today. We need working software, not perfect architecture. Start simple, add complexity when it's actually needed.

**Recommendation:** Follow the **Architect** approach but skip the "consistent storage patterns" talk. Just build it, test it works, iterate.

## Senior Engineer Peer Review

**Status**: success

Looking at these three analyses from a code quality and maintainability perspective:

## Code Quality Assessment

**Architect Analysis** shows the strongest architectural thinking - the emphasis on "consistent storage patterns" and "centralized retry strategy" demonstrates understanding of codebase coherence. However, it lacks concrete implementation details that would reveal actual code quality implications.

**Developer Analysis** prioritizes immediate functionality ("working software immediately") which can lead to technical debt. The "RetryHandler" naming is too generic - a more expressive name like `StorageOperationRetrier` would better communicate intent.

**Tester Analysis** correctly identifies dependency injection benefits but focuses too narrowly on testability without considering the broader maintainability picture.

## Long-term Maintainability Concerns

**Critical Gap**: None of the analyses address **storage key management**. How do we handle comment ID collisions across different PRs? The current approach could create data integrity issues.

**Abstraction Levels**: The Developer's "RetryHandler" risks becoming a god object. Better to have focused retry strategies: `NetworkRetryPolicy`, `StorageRetryPolicy` with different backoff characteristics.

**Evolution Path**: The Architect's "centralized retry strategy" is sound, but we need explicit extension points for different storage backends (file → database → cloud) without breaking existing code.

## Best Practices Assessment

**Strong**: All three correctly identify composition over inheritance - this aligns with modern maintainability principles.

**Concerning**: The Developer analysis mentions "Connect to actual GitHub API endpoints" as a next step, but this suggests the storage abstraction isn't properly isolated from the GitHub concerns. We should be able to test comment persistence without any GitHub dependencies.

**Missing**: Error recovery strategies. What happens when storage is corrupted? How do we handle partial failures during comment marking?

## Team and Codebase Impact

**Recommendation**: Combine the Architect's systematic thinking with the Developer's implementation focus, but add proper error boundaries:

```typescript
interface CommentTrackingService {
  markAsReplied(commentId: CommentId, context: PRContext): Promise<void>;
  getUnrepliedComments(prNumber: number): Promise<CommentId[]>;
}
```

**Key Insight**: The Date vs string issue reveals a broader pattern - we need consistent value object design across the codebase. Consider `Timestamp` value objects instead of raw `Date` instances for better domain modeling.

**Maintainability Priority**: Focus on making the storage layer completely swappable. The retry mechanism should be a cross-cutting concern, not embedded in storage implementations.

The Architect analysis provides the best foundation, but needs concrete implementation guidance to prevent over-engineering.
