## Resolution

Status: resolved
Resolution: Conflicts resolved through consensus building

### Recommendations

- **Issue**: Fundamental disagreement on where retry logic should be implemented
- **Resolution**: Adopt Architect's simplified single-class design with storage abstraction
- **Action**: adopt_architecture

- **Issue**: Disagreement on initial storage technology and implementation sequence
- **Resolution**: Implement FileCommentTracker first for MVP (1-2 days), add SQLite only when concurrent access issues arise
- **Action**: implementation_decision

- **Issue**: Fundamental disagreement on upfront architectural complexity
- **Resolution**: JSON file for <1000 comments, SQLite for production scale, decision point at 2-week mark based on metrics
- **Action**: balance_decision

- **Issue**: Disagreement on whether to prioritize immediate functionality vs. long-term architecture
- **Resolution**: 1. Implement mark_replied() and is_replied() methods
2. Add GitHub integration
3. Add persistence layer
4. Comprehensive testing
- **Action**: prioritize_approach

- **Issue**: Disagreement on following existing codebase patterns vs. creating new approaches
- **Resolution**: Adopt Architect's simplified single-class design with storage abstraction
- **Action**: adopt_architecture
