Status: resolved
Resolution: Conflicts resolved through consensus building

### Recommendations

- **Issue**: Fundamentally different implementation complexity approaches
- **Resolution**: Follow Developer's iterative approach: JSON file storage first, database later based on actual requirements
- **Action**: implementation_decision

- **Issue**: Database technology choice for persistence layer
- **Resolution**: Follow Developer's iterative approach: JSON file storage first, database later based on actual requirements
- **Action**: implementation_decision

- **Issue**: Development methodology and delivery sequence
- **Resolution**: Day 1: Core tracking with basic test, Day 2: Integration, Day 3: Comprehensive test suite
- **Action**: prioritize_approach

- **Issue**: Architecture complexity vs shipping speed
- **Resolution**: Start with Developer explicitly states "Against Architect: 'System integrity' doesn't matter if we never ship" for MVP, evolve to Architect emphasizes "system-level orchestration and failure resilience patterns" as requirements only if performance metrics justify it
- **Action**: balance_decision

- **Issue**: Testing strategy and mock usage
- **Resolution**: Priority tests: 1) test_mark_replied_persists() 2) test_fallback_comment_tracked() 3) test_filter_excludes_replied()
- **Action**: testing_approach
