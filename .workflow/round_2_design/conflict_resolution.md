### Conflict 3
Type: architectural
Description: Design complexity level - full architectural compliance vs MVP simplicity
Severity: medium

### Conflict 4
Type: testing
Description: Dependency injection timing and necessity
Severity: medium

### Conflict 5
Type: tradeoff
Description: Technical debt tolerance - immediate standards compliance vs iterative improvement
Severity: medium


## Resolution

Status: resolved
Resolution: Conflicts resolved through consensus building

### Recommendations

- **Issue**: Storage technology choice - SQLite database vs JSON files for initial implementation
- **Resolution**: Start with FileCommentTracker using JSON (Week 1), migrate to SQLiteCommentTracker in Week 3 if needed
- **Action**: implementation_decision

- **Issue**: Development methodology - test-first vs implementation-first approach
- **Resolution**: Day 1: Core tracking with basic test, Day 2: Integration, Day 3: Comprehensive test suite
- **Action**: prioritize_approach

- **Issue**: Design complexity level - full architectural compliance vs MVP simplicity
- **Resolution**: Combine approaches: Architect requires following existing patterns exactly, stating proposals "violate existing architectural patterns" for simplicity with Developer dismisses this as "architecturally sound but over-engineered for rapid development" and advocates for 30-minute MVP approach for extensibility
- **Action**: adopt_architecture

- **Issue**: Dependency injection timing and necessity
- **Resolution**: Priority tests: 1) test_mark_replied_persists() 2) test_fallback_comment_tracked() 3) test_filter_excludes_replied()
- **Action**: testing_approach

- **Issue**: Technical debt tolerance - immediate standards compliance vs iterative improvement
- **Resolution**: JSON file for <1000 comments, SQLite for production scale, decision point at 2-week mark based on metrics
- **Action**: balance_decision
