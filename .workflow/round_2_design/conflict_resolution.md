## Resolution

Status: resolved
Resolution: Conflicts resolved through consensus building

### Recommendations

- **Issue**: Contradictory recommendations on using abstract base classes vs single concrete implementation
- **Resolution**: Balance rapid iteration with maintainable design patterns
- **Action**: implementation_decision

- **Issue**: Opposing approaches to API testing - mocking vs real API usage
- **Resolution**: Ensure critical paths are tested, balance coverage with development speed
- **Action**: testing_approach

- **Issue**: Disagreement on development methodology - TDD vs iterative implementation
- **Resolution**: Implement core functionality first (comment tracking), then add persistence layer
- **Action**: prioritize_approach

- **Issue**: Fundamental disagreement on whether current analysis is sufficient vs requiring complete restart
- **Resolution**: Adopt repository pattern with dependency injection (combines strengths of both approaches)
- **Action**: adopt_architecture

- **Issue**: Contradictory storage implementation strategies
- **Resolution**: Balance rapid iteration with maintainable design patterns
- **Action**: implementation_decision
