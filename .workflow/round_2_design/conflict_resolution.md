### Recommendations

- **Issue**: Fundamental disagreement on persistence technology
- **Resolution**: Follow Developer's iterative approach: JSON file storage first, database later based on actual requirements
- **Action**: implementation_decision

- **Issue**: Contradictory approaches to implementation sequence
- **Resolution**: 1. Implement mark_replied() and is_replied() methods
2. Add GitHub integration
3. Add persistence layer
4. Comprehensive testing
- **Action**: prioritize_approach

- **Issue**: Disagreement on abstraction level and class design
- **Resolution**: Adopt Architect's simplified single-class design with storage abstraction
- **Action**: adopt_architecture
