Description: Basic tracking vs rich domain context
Severity: medium

### Conflict 4
Type: tradeoff
Description: Blocking vs non-blocking comment tracking
Severity: medium

### Conflict 5
Type: implementation
Description: Pattern copying vs utility extraction
Severity: low


## Resolution

Status: resolved
Resolution: Conflicts resolved through consensus building

### Recommendations

- **Issue**: Fundamental disagreement on abstraction level and inheritance vs composition
- **Resolution**: Combine approaches: Developer/Senior Engineer analyses recommend `AbstractCommentStorage` mirroring the full `SQLiteSymbolStorage` pattern with complete abstract base class hierarchy for simplicity with Senior Engineer Review states "Risk of over-engineering by copying complex symbol indexing patterns for a basic tracking need" and "Should favor composition over inheritance - a simple ReplyTracker service may be better than full storage abstraction" for extensibility
- **Action**: adopt_architecture

- **Issue**: Direct function modification vs decorator pattern for integration
- **Resolution**: Follow Developer's iterative approach: JSON file storage first, database later based on actual requirements
- **Action**: implementation_decision

- **Issue**: Basic tracking vs rich domain context
- **Resolution**: Follow Developer's iterative approach: JSON file storage first, database later based on actual requirements
- **Action**: implementation_decision

- **Issue**: Blocking vs non-blocking comment tracking
- **Resolution**: JSON file for <1000 comments, SQLite for production scale, decision point at 2-week mark based on metrics
- **Action**: balance_decision

- **Issue**: Pattern copying vs utility extraction
- **Resolution**: Follow Developer's iterative approach: JSON file storage first, database later based on actual requirements
