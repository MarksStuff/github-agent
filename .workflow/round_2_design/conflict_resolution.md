Type: architectural
Description: Mixed vs separated concerns for GitHub operations
Severity: medium


## Resolution

Status: resolved
Resolution: Conflicts resolved through consensus building

### Recommendations

- **Issue**: Fundamental disagreement on architectural complexity - abstract base classes vs simple concrete implementation
- **Resolution**: Combine approaches: "Create `AbstractCommentStorage` following `AbstractSymbolStorage` pattern" with full inheritance hierarchy: `AbstractCommentStorage` → `SQLiteCommentStorage` → `ProductionCommentStorage` for simplicity with "The Developer Analysis suggests creating `AbstractCommentStorage` when the requirement is simple comment ID tracking. This could introduce unnecessary complexity" and recommends "Better (simpler) CommentReplyTracker with clear, focused methods" for extensibility
- **Action**: adopt_architecture

- **Issue**: Inheritance vs composition for shared database functionality
- **Resolution**: Follow Developer's iterative approach: JSON file storage first, database later based on actual requirements
- **Action**: implementation_decision

- **Issue**: Direct integration vs decoupled approach for GitHub tool integration
- **Resolution**: Combine approaches: "Integration hooks in `execute_post_pr_reply` and `execute_get_pr_comments`" with direct method modifications for simplicity with "Hooking into `execute_post_pr_reply` and `execute_get_pr_comments` creates tight coupling. A decorator or event-based approach would be more maintainable: `@track_comment_replies`" for extensibility
- **Action**: adopt_architecture

- **Issue**: Comprehensive vs lean testing approach
- **Resolution**: Priority tests: 1) test_mark_replied_persists() 2) test_fallback_comment_tracked() 3) test_filter_excludes_replied()
- **Action**: testing_approach

- **Issue**: Test-first vs implementation-first development approach
- **Resolution**: 1. Implement mark_replied() and is_replied() methods
2. Add GitHub integration
3. Add persistence layer
4. Comprehensive testing
- **Action**: prioritize_approach

- **Issue**: Mixed vs separated concerns for GitHub operations
- **Resolution**: Combine approaches: Suggests adding comment tracking directly to GitHub tools for simplicity with "Better separation" with dedicated `CommentReplyTracker` class: "Keep comment tracking separate from GitHub API operations" for extensibility
- **Action**: adopt_architecture
