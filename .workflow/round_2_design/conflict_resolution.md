## Resolution

Status: resolved
Resolution: Conflicts resolved through consensus building

### Recommendations

- **Issue**: Repository pattern vs simple single class approach
- **Resolution**: Implement Repository pattern with CommentInteractionRepository base class and SQLiteCommentRepository implementation
- **Action**: adopt_architecture

- **Issue**: Storage technology sequence and coupling decisions
- **Resolution**: Implement FileCommentTracker first for MVP (1-2 days), add SQLite only when concurrent access issues arise
- **Action**: implementation_decision

- **Issue**: Development methodology - TDD vs MVP-first approach
- **Resolution**: Day 1: Core tracking with basic test, Day 2: Integration, Day 3: Comprehensive test suite
- **Action**: prioritize_approach

- **Issue**: Class structure and responsibility separation
- **Resolution**: Combine approaches: Developer wants single class approach: "CommentTracker" with simple methods for simplicity with Senior Engineer wants "Split Responsibilities: Separate reply tracking from comment ownership" into CommentReplyHistory and OurCommentRegistry classes for extensibility
- **Action**: adopt_architecture

- **Issue**: Implementation complexity vs time-to-market
- **Resolution**: Start with Developer emphasizes "Ship today" with MVP approach and "Critical: Don't wait for perfect architecture" for MVP, evolve to Tester says implementation "Requires complete testing redesign before implementation" and Senior Engineer wants "enterprise-grade maintainability" only if performance metrics justify it
- **Action**: balance_decision
