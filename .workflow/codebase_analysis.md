# Codebase Analysis

The workspace appears to be completely empty. Could you clarify:

1. Is the GitHub agent codebase located in a different directory that I should access?
2. Should I create the project structure from scratch?
3. Do you have the codebase files that need to be uploaded to this workspace?

Without access to the actual codebase files, I cannot perform the comprehensive design investigation you've requested. I need to examine real Python files, classes, and modules to provide the specific analysis you're looking for with concrete examples and file paths.
