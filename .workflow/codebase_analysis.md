# Codebase Analysis

The workspace is completely empty. There's no codebase to analyze yet. Based on your request to investigate a "Python multi-agent GitHub integration system," it appears we need to either:

1. Clone or create the codebase first
2. You may have meant to provide the codebase files

Could you clarify if:
- You want me to create a new Python multi-agent GitHub integration system from scratch?
- You have a specific repository or codebase you'd like me to work with?
- You'd like me to set up the initial project structure?

Please provide the codebase or let me know how you'd like to proceed with the Python multi-agent GitHub integration system.
