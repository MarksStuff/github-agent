# Codebase Analysis

The workspace is currently empty. I cannot access the codebase at `/Users/mstriebeck/Code/github-agent` from this environment.

To provide the detailed, specific analysis you've requested, I need the actual codebase files to be available. Could you either:

1. Navigate to the `github-agent` directory and run the analysis from there, or
2. Copy/upload the relevant files to the current workspace

Without access to the actual code files, I cannot provide the specific examples you've requested such as:
- Exact class names and their responsibilities
- Specific file paths and code snippets
- Concrete design patterns in use
- Actual naming conventions from the codebase
- Real error handling patterns

Once the codebase is available, I'll thoroughly analyze each aspect you've outlined with specific references to actual classes, methods, and patterns found in the code.
