# Codebase Analysis

The comprehensive codebase design analysis is complete. This Python multi-agent GitHub integration system demonstrates excellent engineering practices with clear separation of concerns, robust testing, and extensible architecture patterns. The codebase follows modern Python standards with comprehensive type annotations, async/await patterns, and dependency injection throughout.

Key architectural highlights include the master-worker process isolation for multi-repository support, plugin-like LSP server management, and comprehensive GitHub integration with MCP (Model Context Protocol) support for AI agent interactions.
