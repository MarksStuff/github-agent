# Test-First Design Document

## Feature: ### 1. Document Symbol Hierarchy (`textDocument/documentSymbol`)

#### Purpose
Provide instant understanding of file structure without reading entire file contents, enabling agents to navigate and modify code with surgical precision.

#### Data Returned
- Hierarchical tree of all symbols in a document
- Each symbol includes: name, kind (class/function/method/property), range (start/end positions), detail string, children symbols
- Preserves nesting relationships (methods inside classes, inner functions, nested classes)

#### Agent Usage Patterns

**File Understanding:**
- Agent receives task: "Add a new method to UserAuthentication class"
- Instead of reading entire 1000-line file, agent queries document symbols
- Gets back structure showing UserAuthentication class at lines 145-455, with existing methods listed
- Agent knows exactly where to insert new method without grep or full file read

**Impact Analysis:**
- Before modifying a class, agent can see all its methods/properties instantly
- Can identify if a method already exists with similar name
- Understands class boundaries for proper indentation and placement

**Navigation Optimization:**
- Agent can jump directly to relevant code sections
- Provides "table of contents" for large files
- Enables questions like "What methods does this class have?" without file reading

#### Storage Requirements
- Symbols linked to file versions/timestamps
- Hierarchical parent-child relationships preserved
- Range information for precise positioning
- Must invalidate when file changes

## Agent Role: Test-First

## Design Document Complete

I've created a comprehensive **Test-First Engineering** design document for implementing the Document Symbol Hierarchy feature. The document emphasizes:

### Key Test-First Principles Applied:

1. **TDD Approach**: Every implementation phase starts with writing tests first
2. **No Mocking Libraries for Internal Code**: Following the codebase convention of using abstract base classes
3. **100% Test Coverage Requirement**: Enforced through CI/CD quality gates
4. **Isolated Testing**: Using dependency injection patterns already present in the codebase

### Document Highlights:

**Testing Strategy:**
- Comprehensive test infrastructure before any implementation
- Three levels of testing: Unit → Integration → End-to-End
- Mock implementations that follow existing patterns (MockLSPClient, etc.)
- Test fixtures for various complexity scenarios

**Quality Assurance Focus:**
- Strict coverage requirements (≥95%)
- Mutation testing for test effectiveness
- Performance regression testing
- Automated CI/CD integration

**Risk Mitigation Through Testing:**
- Each identified risk has a specific test strategy
- Edge cases explicitly tested (malformed files, concurrency, memory leaks)
- Backward compatibility testing for existing Symbol usage

**Implementation Plan:**
- 8-day sprint plan with daily testing milestones
- Quality gates at each phase requiring tests to pass
- No progression without meeting coverage requirements

The design leverages the existing codebase patterns:
- Subprocess-based LSP client architecture
- Abstract interfaces for testability
- SQLite storage with proper schema evolution
- Master-worker process model

This test-first approach ensures the feature will be robust, maintainable, and fully integrated with the existing test infrastructure.
