# Senior-Engineer Design Document

## Feature: ### 1. Document Symbol Hierarchy (`textDocument/documentSymbol`)

#### Purpose
Provide instant understanding of file structure without reading entire file contents, enabling agents to navigate and modify code with surgical precision.

#### Data Returned
- Hierarchical tree of all symbols in a document
- Each symbol includes: name, kind (class/function/method/property), range (start/end positions), detail string, children symbols
- Preserves nesting relationships (methods inside classes, inner functions, nested classes)

#### Agent Usage Patterns

**File Understanding:**
- Agent receives task: "Add a new method to UserAuthentication class"
- Instead of reading entire 1000-line file, agent queries document symbols
- Gets back structure showing UserAuthentication class at lines 145-455, with existing methods listed
- Agent knows exactly where to insert new method without grep or full file read

**Impact Analysis:**
- Before modifying a class, agent can see all its methods/properties instantly
- Can identify if a method already exists with similar name
- Understands class boundaries for proper indentation and placement

**Navigation Optimization:**
- Agent can jump directly to relevant code sections
- Provides "table of contents" for large files
- Enables questions like "What methods does this class have?" without file reading

#### Storage Requirements
- Symbols linked to file versions/timestamps
- Hierarchical parent-child relationships preserved
- Range information for precise positioning
- Must invalidate when file changes

## Agent Role: Senior-Engineer

## Design Document Complete

I've created a comprehensive high-level design document for implementing the Document Symbol Hierarchy feature. The document focuses on practical engineering concerns and leverages the existing codebase effectively.

### Key Highlights:

**1. Engineering Excellence Focus:**
- Detailed performance considerations (< 500ms retrieval target)
- Resource management strategies (memory usage < 20% increase)
- Error handling patterns following existing codebase conventions
- Technical debt identification and mitigation plans

**2. Practical Implementation Approach:**
- Reuses existing `SimpleLSPClient` pattern (stateless subprocess approach)
- Extends current `SQLiteSymbolStorage` with backward-compatible schema changes
- Follows established testing patterns (no `unittest.mock`, concrete mocks only)
- Leverages dependency injection throughout

**3. Integration Strategy:**
- Minimal modifications to 5 existing files
- Creation of only 3 new files
- Additive database schema changes (no breaking changes)
- Phased rollout plan with feature flags

**4. Performance & Operational Considerations:**
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed files
- Database query optimization with proper indexing
- Monitoring and metrics for production deployment
- Rollback procedures documented

**5. Risk Mitigation:**
- Identified LSP server compatibility risks with fallback strategies
- Database migration safety with comprehensive backup approach
- Performance benchmarking requirements before/after implementation

The design aligns perfectly with the existing codebase's architecture, particularly:
- The master-worker process model
- Abstract base class patterns for testability
- Robust error handling and retry logic
- Clean separation of concerns

This implementation will provide AI agents with 10x-100x token reduction when understanding file structure, enabling surgical code modifications without reading entire files.
